                        English Novel, 1770-1829: A Bibliographical Survey of 
                        Prose Fiction Published in the British Isles</i>, general 
                        editors Peter Garside, James Raven, and Rainer Schöwerling, 
                        2 vols (Oxford: OUP, 2000). In particular it offers fresh 
                        commentary on the entries in the second volume, which 
                        was co-edited by Peter Garside and Rainer Schöwerling, 
                        with the assistance of Christopher Skelton-Foord and Karin 
                        Wünsche, and involved close co-operation between Cardiff 
                        University and Paderborn University in Germany. The present 
                        report is the second Update in what is intended to be 
                        a series of annual Reports, each featuring information 
                        that has come to light in the preceding year as a result 
                        of activities in the Centre for Editorial and Intertextual 
                        Research and through contributions sent by interested 
                        individuals outside Cardiff.</p>
                      <p align="justify">The entries below are organised in a 
                        way that matches the order of material in the <i>English 
                        Novel, 1770-1829</i>. While making reference to any relevant 
                        changes that may have occurred in Update 1, the 'base' 
                        it refers to is the printed Bibliography and not the preceding 
                        report. Sections A and B concern authorship, with the 
                        first of these proposing changes to the attribution as 
                        given in the printed Bibliography, and the second recording 
                        the discovery of new information of interest that has 
                        nevertheless not led presently to new attributions. Sections 
                        C includes three additional titles which match the criteria 
                        for inclusion and should ideally have been incorporated 
                        in the printed Bibliography, while the last two sections 
                        involve information such as is usually found in the <i>Notes</i> 
                        field of entries, and those owning copies of the printed 
                        Bibliography might wish (as in the case of the earlier 
                        categories) to amend entries accordingly. An element of 
                        colour coding has been used to facilitate recognition 
                        of the nature of changes, with <font color="#990033">red</font> 
                        denoting revisions and additions to existing entries in 
                        the Bibliography, and the additional titles discovered 
                        being picked out in <font color="#005572">blue</font>. 
                        References numbers (e.g. 1806: 12) are the same as those 
                        in the <i>English Novel, 1770-1829</i>; when found as 
                        cross references these refer back to the original Bibliography, 
                        unless accompanied with 'above' or 'below', in which case 
                        a cross reference within the present report is intended. 
                        Abbreviations match those listed at the beginning volume 
                        2 of the <i>English Novel,</i> though in a few cases these 
                        are spelled out more fully for the convenience of present 
                        readers.</p>

                        with significant inputs of information from Drs Jacqueline 
                        Belanger and Sharon Ragaz, largely through their work 
                        on our Database of Fiction 1800-29 project, and from Dr 
                        Anthony Mandal, primarily through his work on extending 
                        the bibliographical record of fiction to 1836. Information 
                        was also generously communicated by a number of individuals, 
                        notably: Mr Roger Bettridge, of the Buckinghamshire County 
                        Record Office; Mr Peter Doyle, a descendant of George 
                        Matcham; Professors Rolf Loeber and Magda Stouthamer-Loeber, 
                        from Pittsburgh University; Professor Pam Perkins, University 
                        of Manitoba; Professor David Skilton, Cardiff University; 
                        Professor Wil Verhoeven, University of Groningen; and 
                        Mr Caspar Wintermans, The Hague. As usual the team has 
                        greatly benefited from its association with Projekt Corvey 
                        at Paderborn University, particularly in this instance 
                        through information received from Verena Ebbes and Angela 
                        Koch. Thanks are also due the trustees of the National 
                        Library of Scotland for permission to quote from manuscript

                        (1802<i>-</i>?), but on a misreading of his source from 
                        <i>Notes and Queries</i> 215 (October 1970), 382<i>-</i>3. 
                        The article in question, 'The Authorship of "Concealment"&nbsp;', 
                        by Dorothy R. Scheele, unequivocally concerns the novel 
                        of the same title published by Bentley in 1837, which 
                        on her evidence is clearly attributable to Mary Fletcher 
                        (later Richardson), the youngest daughter Eliza Fletcher 
                        (1770-1858), the wife of the Scottish lawyer Archibald 
                        Fletcher and herself leader of an Edinburgh intellectual-literary 
                        circle. After the publication of this 1837 novel, in a 
                        letter of September 1838, Eliza Fletcher wrote to Allan 
                        Cunningham: 'He [Bentley] offered to take the risk of 
                        the publication and to share the profits with the author 
                        - at the end of a year and a half he sends her an acct. 
                        charging between £30 &amp; £40 for advertizing the Book. 
                        - ten percent upon the copies sold - which after deducting 
                        the Expense of paper and printing leaves her a profit 
                        of 10/!!! So much for a Lady's authorship. - He owns to 
                        the sale of between 200 and 300 Copies. I mention this 
                        in confidence - you will not allow it to go further' (National 
                        Library of Scotland, MS 2617, f.90). Along with CONCEALMENT, 
                        OR THE CASCADE OF LLANTWARRYHN (1801: 27), by the shadowy 
                        Mrs E. M. Foster, this means there were at least three 
                        novels with the lead title <i>Concealment</i> published 
                        between 1800 and 1837. Thanks are due to Pam Perkins for 
                        drawing attention to the letter from Eliza Fletcher.</p>

                        worth noting that the same attribution is found in the 
                        earlier manuscript Catalogue of Bentley Publications held 
                        by the British Library (BL Add MSS 46637), covering the 
                        years 1829-1837. The evidence in favour of Crowe's rather 
                        than Phipps's authorship of this title, as well as of 
                        <i>Historiettes</i> (1827: 27) and <i>The English in France</i> 
                        (1828: 34), now seems to approach the overwhelming. </p>

                        Library (BL Add MSS 46637) the name of William Pitt Scargill

                        also Update 1. Preface states of the author's intentions: 
                        'His simple object is to convey instruction in a pleasing 
                        manner, and maintain fairly and charitably that Doctrine 
                        which is accordant to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to 
                        the Established Church, which he firmly and conscientiously 
                        believes founded on that rock of ages' (p. ix).The constituent 
                        tales are: 'The Gipsy Girl', pp. [3] -40; 'Religious Offices' 
                        pp. [43] -95; 'Enthusiasm', pp. [99] -148; 'Romanism', 
                        pp. [151]-197; 'Rashness' [201] -250; 'De Lawrence' [253] 
                        -312. 'Romanism' in particular takes an anti-Emancipationist 
                        stance. 'Appendix', pp. [317] -24 is purely theological 
                        in content.</font></p>
