                        Prose Fiction Published in the British Isles,</i> general 
                        editors Peter Garside, James Raven, and Rainer Schöwerling, 
                        2 vols. (Oxford: OUP, 2000). In particular it offers fresh 
                        commentary on the entries in the second volume [EN2], 
                        which was co-edited by Peter Garside and Rainer Schöwerling, 
                        with the assistance of Christopher Skelton-Foord and Karin 
                        Wünsche. The present report is the fourth (and last) Update 
                        in a series of annual Reports, each featuring information 
                        that has come to light in the preceding year as a result 
                        of activities in CEIR and through contributions sent by 
                        interested individuals outside Cardiff.</p>
                      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entries 
                        below are organised in a way that matches the order of 
                        material in the <i>English Novel, 1770-1829</i>. While 
                        it makes reference to any relevant changes that may have 
                        occurred in Updates 1-3, the 'base' it normally refers 
                        to is the printed Bibliography and not the preceding reports. 
                        Sections A and B concern authorship, with the first of 
                        these proposing changes to the attribution as given in 
                        the printed Bibliography, and the second recording the 
                        discovery of new information of interest that has nevertheless 
                        not led presently to new attributions. Section C includes 
                        three additional titles which match the criteria for inclusion 
                        and should ideally have been incorporated in the printed 
                        Bibliography, while Section E involves information such 
                        as is usually found in the <i>Notes</i> field of entries, 
                        and those owning copies of the printed Bibliography might 
                        wish (as in the case of the earlier categories) to amend 
                        entries accordingly. An element of colour coding has been 
                        used to facilitate recognition of the nature of changes, 
                        with <font color="#990033">red</font> denoting revisions 
                        and additions to existing entries in the Bibliography, 
                        and the additional titles discovered being picked out 
                        in <font color="#4476B5">blue</font>. Reference numbers 
                        (e.g. 1806: 12) are the same as those in the <i>English 
                        Novel, 1770-1829</i>; when found as cross references these 
                        refer back to the original Bibliography, unless accompanied 
                        with 'above' or 'below', in which case a cross reference 
                        within the present report is intended. Abbreviations match 
                        those listed at the beginning volume 2 of the <i>English 
                        Novel,</i> though in a few cases these are spelled out 
                        more fully for the convenience of present readers.</p>

                        (and its addenda) were prepared by Peter Garside, with 
                        significant inputs of information from Drs Jacqueline 
                        Belanger and Sharon Ragaz, on this occasion especially 
                        as a result of a survey of relevant entries in the Ledgers 
                        of the Longman Archives, and work with the Oliver &amp; 
                        Boyd and Blackwood Papers in the National Library of Scotland. 
                        Information was also generously communicated by a number 
                        of individuals, including: Andrew Ashfield, Richard Beaton, 
                        Emma Clery, Isobel Grundy, David Skilton, John Strachan, 
                        and (once more) Professors Rolf Loeber and Magda Stouthamer-Loeber. 
                        As before, the Cardiff team has benefited from its association 
                        with Projekt Corvey at Paderborn University, most recently 
                        through the joint preparation of a <i>Bibliography of 
                        Fiction, 1830-1836</i> (available now within Cardiff Corvey, 
                        and abbreviated below as EN3). Thanks are also due to 
                        Michael Bott, of Reading University Library, for help 
                        received in locating materials in the Longman archives; 
                        to Miss Virginia Murray for support and guidance with 
                        the Murray archives; and to the trustees of the National

                        printed <i>Poems</i> (Oxford, 1811), pp. 31-2, these matching

                        at <font size="-1">I</font>, 116. Further comparison has 
                        revealed that 5 other poetical pieces in the novel are 
                        reprinted in Philipps's <i>Poems</i>, constituting nearly 
                        a third of the items in that volume. Little else has been 
                        found about Janetta Philipps, other than that Shelley 
                        praised her poems and was active in collecting subscribers 
                        for the 1811 volume (see Jackson, p. 256). Thanks are 
                        due to Andrew Ashfield for drawing attention to 'Stanzas

                        Longman Divide Ledger (CD, p. 221) and Commission Ledger 
                        (IC, p. 21) show that 6 copies were sent to Mrs Ives at 
                        Yarmouth and that half profits were paid to a 'Mrs H.'. 
                        'Mrs Ives Hurry' is given as the author on the title-page 
                        of <i>Artless Tales</i> (1808: 59), also published by 
                        Longmans. Mrs Hurry's maiden name was Margaret Mitchell. 
                        The subscription list to <i>Artless Tales</i> includes 
                        6 Yarmouth subscribers, including a Mr James Hurry (among 
                        11 of that surname). The same list also includes a Mrs 
                        T. Ives, who subscribes for 3 copies, as well as three 
                        Miss Mitchells. The ledger nomination of Mrs H. apparently 
                        as the author, similarity of publisher, and a coincidence 
                        of names and East Anglian connections, point strongly 
                        (though not decisively) towards authorship of the above

                        Longman Divide Ledger (ID, p. 88) shows a number of copies, 
                        some in special bindings, being sent to 'Mr Merrivale' 
                        (or 'Mr M'). This raises the possibility that the author 
                        of this work was John Herman Merivale. Merivale's brother-in-law 
                        was Henry Joseph Thomas Drury (1778-1841), and it is noticeable 
                        that a copy of the novel was also sent to 'H. Drury Esq'. 
                        Merivale was a classical scholar, whose works included 
                        <em>Collections from the Greek Anthology and from the 
                        Pastoral, Elegiac, and Dramatic Poets of Greece</em> (London, 
                        1813). He was also a contributor to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>.</font><font size="-1"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></font></p>

                        Divide Ledger (ID, p. 50) shows 6 copies in boards being 
                        sent to 'Miss Porter'. This indicates a connection with 
                        either Jane or Anna Maria Porter, and beyond that possible 
                        authorship by a member of the Porter family. Sir Robert 
                        Ker Porter (1772-1842), their elder brother, had travelled 
                        extensively in Russia, Germany, Finland and Sweden, since 
                        1804, and more recently had accompanied Sir John Moore 
                        on his expedition to Spain. He was the acknowledged author 
                        of <i>Letters from Portugal and Spain, written during 
                        the march of the British Troops under Sir John Moore</i> 
                        (1809), published by Longman &amp; Co, for whom he also 
                        wrote other travel books. In the Preface to the present 
                        work, the author refers to his having added notes to 'the 
                        Spanish story', but having desisted from doing the same 
                        in the case of 'the Sicilian, Swiss, or Portuguese stories' 
                        (vii-viii) Granting the present attribution to Sir Robert 
                        Ker Porter, and the almost certain authorship of <i>Sir 
                        Edward Seaward's Narrative of His Shipwreck</i> (EN3 1831: 
                        57) by William Ogilvie Porter, this would place four of 
                        the Porter siblings as writers of fiction.</font></font></p>

                        Feb 1815, reads: 'The first edition, under the title of 
                        <i>Marie, ou les peines de l'amour</i>, was printed at 
                        Gratz, in the year 1812. Of that edition, a reprint appeared 
                        in Paris, but, from whatever cause, not before the beginning 
                        of the year 1814. In the interim, the author had made 
                        several alterations in his work, changing some of the 
                        minor incidents of the story, and consequently suppressing 
                        some of his pages, and adding others; and, in the month 
                        of June, 1814, he conveyed, by a written paper, dated 
                        at Lausanne, in Switzerland, and signed "L. de St. Leu," 
                        to a particular bookseller in Paris, authority to print, 
                        from the original manuscript, with its alterations, a 
                        second edition of his book, under the new title of <i>Marie,

                        of £20 sterling for the copyright of this title (Letter 
                        Book, Agreements, 1814-47; NLS, Accession 5000/140). In 
                        the index to the same Letter Book, the author is listed 
                        under 'Alexander, Gabriel, Advocate'. This is almost certainly 
                        the same Alexander Gabriel who was admitted to the Faculty 
                        of Advocates on 25 Jan 1817, and died in 1868. In a letter 
                        of 11 Apr 1834 to the Royal Literary Fund, to whom an 
                        appeal was made, Alexander describes his work as 'a seven

                        Boyd Edin. 1828' (RLF 25: 789, Item 1). James Rennie, 
                        writing on his behalf on 20 April 1834, also states that 
                        'The only volume he has had published is 'My Grandfather's 
                        Farm' which I am told in P[aternoster] R[ow] sold very 
                        well' (Item 2). The RLF records show that Alexander was

                        RUSSIAN TALES. Examination of the 1804 reissue, titled 
                        <i>Tales from the Russian of Nicolai Karamsin</i> (BL 
                        12590 f. 90), shows a completely different set of preliminaries, 
                        which themselves strongly argue for the attribution of 
                        the translation to Andreas Andersen Feldborg. These consist 
                        of a dedication 'to Mr A de Gyldenpalm, His Danish Majesty's 
                        Charge D'Affaires At the Court of Great Britain &amp;c', 
                        in which 'The Translator' speaks 'As a native of Denmark'; 
                        and also a 'Translator's Preface' in which the same translator 
                        refers to having 'already the honour of introducing my 
                        author to the British Public, by the translation of his 
                        Travels'. This latter presumably relates to Karamzin's 
                        <i>Travels from Moscow, through Prussia, Germany, Switzerland, 
                        France, and England</i> (London: Printed for J. Badcock 
                        by G. Sidney, 1803)-see OCLC Accession No. 9213044, which 
                        states translated from the German, though no translator 
                        is given. Translation of both works by the same Dane is 
                        strongly implied in a letter of Isaac D'Israeli to John 
                        Murray II, probably belonging to 1803, in the Murray Archives. 
                        Here D'Israeli states: 'I heard last night that Karamsin's 
                        Travels is a very indifferent book. This does not augur 
                        well for Karamsin's Tales; the work in question of the 
                        Dane's. I give you this information <i>in time</i>, that 
                        you may not plunge headlong into any independent engagement 
                        respecting the work. If he has printed 900, it is a good 
                        many; parts of the work should not extend beyond the circle 
                        of a Circulating Library.' It is worth noting that Sidney, 
                        the printer of Karamzin's Travels, appears on the title-pages 
                        of both the 1803 and 1804 Karamzin <i>Tales</i>: alone 
                        in the first case (indicating a private publication), 
                        and with 'J. Johnson, St Paul's Church-Yard' in the second 
                        case. The main body of the work is both instances is made 
                        up from the same sheets, suggesting possibly that Johnson 
                        had bought up remaindered stock for the second issue. 
                        (The 1804 reissue also lacks the two plates found in the 
                        1803 issue, the second of which, facing p. 204, bears 
                        the legend 'Published Novemr 5th 1803'.) If however Feldborg 
                        is adjudged translator, this not only leaves the large 
                        problem of the 1803 edition's title-page attribution of 
                        the translation to John Battersby Elrington, but also 
                        the questions posed by a different set of preliminaries 
                        profiling Elrington as an entirely different kind of entity. 
                        The address 'To My Friends' there in particular refers 
                        to the translator as being 'a Gentleman in Prison, labouring 
                        for Bread'. One potential solution is that Elrington is 
                        a pseudonym of Feldborg's, though this seems a large conjectural 
                        step to take. For further commentary on the larger issues 
                        involved, see Addendum 1 to this Update concerning 'Charles

                        The possibility that Elrington is a pseudonym, and/or 
                        of an involvement by Andreas Anderson Feldborg as translator, 
                        is opened up by the case of 1803: 38 above. The licentiousness 
                        of much of the present text, at least in its translated 
                        form, might seem to match the Elrington persona; translation 
                        of an extensive text 'from the German' would seem to accord 
                        more with Feldborg. One linking factor is the appearance 
                        of G. Sidney as printer again on the titles. For further 
                        commentary on the larger issues involved, see Addendum

                        following Andrew Block, though no actual copy has been 
                        located. <i>A Tour in Zealand, in the Year 1802</i> (London, 
                        1805), as mentioned in the title above, however, is a 
                        work by Andreas Andersen Feldborg. It is probably significant 
                        too that the pseudonym of 'J. A. Anderson' was used for 
                        Feldborg's later work, <i>A Dane's Excursions in Britain</i> 
                        (1809), where again incidentally the titles refer to the 
                        writer as 'Author of a Tour in Zealand'. In this light 
                        it seems likely that: (a) the pseudonym Andreas Anderson

                        does not gain further credence from the record of the 
                        latter's appeals to the Royal Literary Fund. A letter 
                        of 27 Aug 1814 to the Fund (RLF 9: 317, Item 1) acknowledges 
                        only 'Vacation Evenings and the little Volume abbreviated 
                        from the Zadig of Voltaire, entitled by her, Zadig and

                        1809 1810' as individual publications. In the same letter, 
                        Bayley describes herself as 'the Widow of the late Major 
                        Henry Bayley of the Royal Marines', her lack of a widow's 
                        pension (her husband having died nine years ago on half-pay), 
                        and later refers to pieces published by her in periodicals, 
                        'particularly the European Magazine'. No suggestion is 
                        made however of the three chain titles published by 'Kate 
                        Montalbion' and associable with Mrs Bayley (1810: 24, 
                        25, and the above work). Another letter of appeal to the 
                        Fund, dated 12 Nov 1816, again mentions only 'the Vacation 
                        Evenings-<i>now</i> out of print-and my Zadig from Voltaire, 
                        which is nearly so'. The same letter goes on to describe 
                        how 'I have been ill many months, and am <i>now</i> so 
                        reduced that every garment, every necessary even my Wedding

                        (RLF 9: 317, Item 16). Of course it is quite possible 
                        that Bayley did not wish to acknowledge three novels published 
                        by two far less salubrious publishers than Longmans, viz. 
                        J. F. Hughes and Allen &amp; Co. The apparent reissuing 
                        of <i>A Set-Down at Court</i> in 1816 also tallies interestingly 
                        with Catharine Bayleys's last desperate appeal to the

                        works by her (RLF 9: 324, Item 1). The same letter, written

                        in the Navy and another established as a governess. The 
                        letter continues that the bankruptcy of both the person

                        (signed A Yosy) of 1833 to the Royal Literary Fund: 'I 
                        have subjoined a list of the works which I have published 
                        being besides the Switzerland 2 Classic Tales and a novel

                        (RLF 16: 534, Item 11). The last work mentioned must be 
                        <i>Constancy and Leopold</i> (1818: 62), which in the 
                        titles is given as by 'Madame Yossy, author of Switzerland'. 
                        The 'Switzerland' thus mentioned is evidently <i>Switzerland 
                        [.] Interspersed with Historical Anecdotes</i> (2 vols., 
                        1815), the poor returns for which is a subject of complaint

                        (16: 534, Item 4). As argued in the relevant entries of 
                        EN2, the confusion of Yossy's non-fictional <i>Switzerland</i> 
                        with <i>Tales from Switzerland</i> (1822: 12) best explains 
                        the almost certainly incorrect attribution of the latter 
                        title and its successors to her authorship. Unfortunately 
                        the list of titles mentioned in the letter of 1833 to 
                        RLF has apparently not survived. The name of John Hefford 
                        has not been found in association with any other title 
                        of this period, nor has anything positive been discovered 
                        about the 'Commercial College, Woodford' as given as his 
                        domain in the extended title of the present work. One 
                        wonders whether the '2 Classic Tales' claimed in 1833 
                        represent this title, possibly written in association 
                        with Yossy at an educational establishment. The address 
                        given at the head of Yossy's letter of 24 May 1825, however, 
                        is 14 Pultney Terrace, Pentonville.<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>

                        BON TON: AND BON TON BY PROFESSION. A NOVEL. George Jones 
                        is identified as the author of the chain of novels associated 
                        with the pseudonymous Leigh Cliffe (see also 1822: 49, 
                        1823: 49, 1829: 49). This sequence of novels in nevertheless 
                        claimed by Christian Frederick Wieles in approaches to 
                        the Royal Literary Fund. The first letter of appeal, of 
                        13 Nov 1821 and signed Christian F. Wieles, mentions his 
                        having 'published several works exclusive of criticisms 
                        and miscellaneous articles for the <i>London Magazine</i>', 
                        and refers to his forwarding of what could be the present 
                        work: 'I presume to send three volumes of a light work 
                        which I have published with far more praise than profit' 
                        (RLF 12: 444, Item 1). In another letter of 10 June 1823 
                        Wieles specifically mentions the two subsequent 'Leigh 
                        Cliffe' titles, both of which list <i>Supreme Bon Ton</i> 
                        as a work by the same author on their title-pages: 'My 
                        case is very hard, and I am placed in the most unpleasant 
                        circumstances through the conduct of my Publisher, who, 
                        for two works-"The Knights of Ritzburg" and "Temptation" 
                        has only given me two small Bills of Five pounds each, 
                        which have been months overdue and are not yet, even in 
                        part, paid' (12: 444, Item 3). All four novels in the 
                        chain are listed by title and date in a later appeal to 
                        RLF in 1842 (12: 444, Item 14): the same application also 
                        listing the poem <i>Parga</i> (1819). The London addresses 
                        given at the head the letters of 1821 and 1823 are, respectively, 
                        32 Frederic Place, Hampstead Road, and 9 Tonbridge Street, 
                        Brunswick Square. The 1842 application involves a printed 
                        form, on which the applicant describes himself as 'Christian 
                        Frederic Wieles Leigh Cliffe', his address as 27 S[outh] 
                        Howland Street, Fitzroy Square, and his age as 43. On 
                        the surface of things this would seem to offer rock-hard 
                        evidence for attribution to Wieles rather than Jones. 
                        However caution is still needed, arguably, pending an 
                        explanation for the name George Jones.</p>

                        direct connection. Examination of the two works themselves

                        of a number of novels from 1818 on. It is of course possible 
                        that Byerley (editor of the <i>Literary Chronicle</i>

                        also be worth noting that OCLC (Accession 20312659) attributes

                        Title as conjectured derives from Corvey 2nd edn. 1802. 
                        Catalologue (1808) of Richards's Circulating Library nevertheless 
                        lists 'Parental Turpitude, or the Mysteries of Abruzzo'. 
                        This is matched by ECB 432, which has: 'Parental turpitude; 
                        or the Mysteries of Abruzzo. 12mo, 3s, Treppas, Aug. 1801.' 
                        This might then represent the 1st edn. and original title 
                        of present work, though it is worth noting that the ECB 
                        pricing points to a smaller production than 1802: 8.</p>

                        MODERN AND FASHIONABLE LIFE. OCLC (Accession No. 52903117) 
                        describes the following: <i>Nothing New! or, Louisa, the 
                        Orphan of Lennox Abbey: a Novel </i>(London, J. Barfield, 
                        3 vols., 1803). It should be noted that 1803: 11, with 
                        its different sub-title, bears the printer's mark of J. 
                        Barfield. There is a strong likelihood that this and the 
                        present title are variant issues of the same novel as 
                        published in 1803. This in turn reinforces the view that 
                        <i>Louisa; or, the Orphan of Lenox Abbey</i> (1807: 1) 
                        is a reissue, in which case ideally it should not have

                        point to at least a share by that firm in the publication. 
                        All secondary sources seen, however, reinforce the Sherwood,

                        (Jan 1815), p. 102. The format is given as 12mo (no pagination

                        &amp; Co. 1814. The short notice reads: 'The heroine of 
                        this tale is a young lady of Norway, attired in a gypsey 
                        straw-bonnet, who refreshes herself after sultry days 
                        by taking evening walks along "the winding shores of the

                        This new evidence strengthens the claim for this work 
                        to be included in the main listings, though some uncertainty

                        Novel, 1770-1829</i>. Four of these bore the name of Charles 
                        Sedley on the title-page: <i>The Barouche Driver and his 
                        Wife: A Tale for Haut Ton</i> (1807: 57); <i>The Infidel 
                        Mother; or, Three Winters in London </i>(1807: 58); <i>The 
                        Faro Table; or, the Gambling Mothers</i> (1808: 97); and 
                        <i>A Winter in Dublin: A Descriptive Tale</i> (1808: 98). 
                        A fifth title (evidently the last in the series), <i>Asmodeus; 
                        or, the Devil in London</i> (1808: 96), effectively identifies 
                        Sedley through title-page attribution to 'the Author of 
                        "The Faro Table," "A Winter in Dublin", &amp;c. &amp;c. 
                        &amp;c.'; while a sixth (and probably the first), <i>The 
                        Mask of Fashion; A Plain Tale</i> (1807: 59), though sometimes 
                        given to Thomas Skinner Surr, is mentioned as a work of 
                        Sedley's on the titles of <i>The Winter in Dublin</i> 
                        and <i>The Infidel Mother</i>.</p>

                        titles were published by James Fletcher Hughes, then tilting

                        towards a peculiarly acerbic kind of topical 'scandal' 
                        fiction: see Peter Garside, 'J. F. Hughes and the Publication 
                        of Popular Fiction, 1803-1810, <i>The Library</i>, 6th 
                        ser. 9.3 (September 1987), 240-58. All six 'Sedley' titles 
                        featured a dated preface or dedication, indicative of 
                        a fashionably mobile person: <i>The Mask of Fashion</i>, 
                        London, November 1806;<i> The Infidel Mother</i>, London, 
                        March 1807; <i>The Barouche Driver and His Wife</i>, Brighton 
                        Cliffs, 19 July 1807; <i>A Winter in Dublin</i>, Ramsgate, 
                        17 October, 1807; <i>Asmodeus</i>, London, April 1808. 
                        Two are dedicated to aristocratic figures: <i>The Mask 
                        of Fashion</i> to the Duchess of St Albans; and <i>The 
                        Barouche Driver</i> to the Earl and Countess of Jersey. 
                        As a whole, a strong sense of a palpable originating author 
                        is given in the preliminaries (the BL copy of the <i>Barouche 
                        Driver</i> actually has an inscription 'From the Author' 
                        on the half-title to vol. 1). When assailed on the score 
                        of slander in <i>A Winter in Dublin</i>, J. F. Hughes 
                        (according to a 'Postcript' [<i>sic</i>] by him in <i>The 
                        Faro Table</i>) denied the existence of any real author 
                        named Sedley: 'I informed him that Charles Sedley was 
                        a fictitious person' (ii, 182). Hughes's own presence 
                        tends to be increasingly invasive in the later titles.</p>
                      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who then 
                        might have been Sedley? Though the majority of modern 
                        catalogues list it without indicating pseudonymity, the 
                        name most probably derives from the Restoration rake, 
                        Sir Charles Sedley (1639-1701; and who, in OCLC, is listed 
                        as author of these novels!). Sedley was also commonly 
                        used as a name for licentitious characters in contemporary 
                        fiction. For instance, Frances Burney's Sir Sedley Clarendel 
                        in <i>Camilla</i> (1796), or Isaac D'Israeli's Sedley 
                        in <i>Vaurien</i> (1797), whose 'life was a system of 
                        refined Epicurism' (<font size="-1">II</font>, 58). Research 
                        carried out in CEIR during the last three years, especially 
                        by Jacqueline Belanger, has brought us tantalisingly close 
                        to identifying a true author, though in the final count 
                        the sheer complexities of the evidence discovered has 
                        made it necessary to withdraw from positive identification. 
                        The remainder of this report concentrates on three possible 
                        contenders for the dubious credit of authorship.<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>

                        in Elysium</i> (1804: 71). On the surface of things, these 
                        two foreign works (both probably translated from German) 
                        look unlikely sources. Rather surprisingly, however, each 
                        contains prefatory material reminiscent in some respects 
                        of the Sedley preliminaries. In <i>Russian Tales</i> an 
                        unpaginated address 'To My Friends', signed 'J. B. E. 
                        Borough Oct 10, 1803', figures the translator as 'but 
                        a Gentleman in Prison, labouring for Bread. It is a trifle 
                        [.] without merit; [.] a mere essay in Famine'. Another 
                        such statement, 'To the World', also contains just a hint 
                        (albeit metaphorically) of the voluptuary mode that was 
                        to become one of Sedley's trademarks: 'I have attempted 
                        to dress a Foreign Beauty in an English Costume; and, 
                        while the simplicity of Nature, and the sensibilities 
                        of the heart, are objects of admiration, I have every 
                        thing to hope-nothing to apprehend.'</p>
                      <p align="justify"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confessions 
                        in Elysium</i>, for its part, includes a dedication 'to 
                        His Royal Highness Prince William Frederick of Glocester 
                        [<i>sic</i>]', signed 'I. B. Elrington, London, March 
                        1st, 1804'. It also contains its own address 'To the World', 
                        where again one senses an inclination towards voluptuary 
                        language, as well as a penchant for extended ellipses, 
                        suggestive of either breathless wonder and/or unmentionable 
                        material; this last address is signed 'I. B. E., London, 
                        March 1st 1804'. In this instance, such intimations are 
                        fully realised, in a species of erotic description that 
                        may or may not derive from Wieland: 'She [an "amorous 
                        Priestess"] half reclined upon a sopha magnificently embroidered 
                        [.] and richly spangled with pearls and variegated precious 
                        stones . There was an easy negligence in her dress' (<font size="-1">II</font>, 
                        155). It is also worth noting the similarity between Elrington's 
                        full name and that of 'John Battersby', the named author 
                        of <i>Tell-Tale Sophas: an Eclectic Fable</i> (1814: 12), 
                        which is filled with similar descriptions along with the 
                        more domestic scandal materials associated with Sedley. 
                        Perhaps significantly the printer of <i>Tell-Tale Sophas</i> 
                        is D. N. Shury, J. F. Hughes's most commonly used printer 
                        (there is a possibility of a later issue of sheets which 
                        had fallen victim of Hughes's collapse in 1809/10).</p>

                        of strong intimations that Elrington was the concealed 
                        author of the 'Sedley' titles have been discovered in 
                        <i>The Satirist, or, Monthly Meteor</i>, a periodical 
                        (founded in 1807) deeply involved in the scandals surrounding 
                        the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Duke of York, 
                        <i>c</i>. 1807-9. In a series of review articles attacking 
                        Sedley with all-out vigour, this magazine all but spelled 
                        out what in completed form is surely meant to be Elrington. 
                        For instance, in its review of <i>The Infidel Mother</i>: 
                        '[.] the cloven foot of E--n stares the reader full in 
                        the face throughout this Infidel Mother: which, to conclude, 
                        is one of the most disgusting farragoes of absurdity ever 
                        put together' (vol. 1, 1 November 1807, p. 185). Likewise, 
                        aprops <i>Asmodeus</i>: 'When we contemplate the present 
                        piteous condition of the wretched Charles Sedley, <i>alias</i> 
                        E--n, we cannot repress that species of compassion which 
                        a humane judge would feel at the sight of a criminal, 
                        whom he had sentenced, expiring on the rack' (vol. 2, 
                        1 June 1808, p. 438). In other articles, <i>The Satirist</i> 
                        uncovered what it took to be the same authorship of two 
                        works dealing more directly with the topical royal scandals 
                        (see under 1807: 19 in Update 4 above). Lastly, in alluding 
                        to a civil action for damages in which its publisher was 
                        the defendant, <i>The Satirist</i> at the onset of a feature 
                        titled 'The Satirist and Pickpockets' spelled out the 
                        name in full: 'The <font size="-1">SATIRIST</font> having 
                        excited the wrath of Messrs. Finnerty, Hague, Ellrington,

                        fraternity of pickpockets [.]' (vol. 4, 1 January 1809,

                        of a real John Battersby Elrington. Perhaps significant, 
                        too, is <i>The Satirist</i>'s apparent uncertainty at

                        most unlikely of candidates, were it not for a bibliographical 
                        mystery surrounding the English translation of Karamzin's 
                        <i>Tales</i>. As described in Update 4 (see under 1803: 
                        38), the 1804 reissue of this work lacks any mention of 
                        Elrington in the title or preliminaries, while the latter 
                        strongly suggest the very different persona of a Danish 
                        translator (while at the same time in procedure strangely 
                        paralleling the Elrington preliminaries). This time the 
                        dedication (dated 'London, 5th Nov. 1803' and signed 'The 
                        Translator') is to the Danish Ambassador. The 'Translator's 
                        Preface' then alludes to previous work on Karamzin's <i>Travels</i> 
                        (1803), for the accomplishment of which he expresses gratitude 
                        to 'her royal Highness the Duchess of York' (p. v). Correspondence 
                        in the Murray archives (see Update 4) also points to the 
                        translation of both Karamzin's <i>Tales</i> and <i>Travels</i> 
                        by the same Dane, who, even without this kind of support, 
                        seems a more likely translator of foreign literature than 
                        Elrington. One noticeable typographical feature of the 
                        main sheets, which are identical in both issues, is the 
                        use of a succession of a dots, in the form of extended 
                        ellipses, to indicate pauses etc.</p>
                      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According 
                        the <i>Dansk Biografisk Lexicon</i> (Copenhagen, 1887-1905), 
                        Feldborg (who is described as a 'literary vagabond') came 
                        to England in 1802, wrote on the English naval victory 
                        over the Danes, translated materials, and returned to 
                        Denmark in 1810. There is also evidence that he dabbled 
                        at least once more in fiction. For evidence indicating 
                        that <i>Mental Recreations. Four Danish and German Tales</i>, 
                        apparently written as by 'Andreas Anderson', was his work, 
                        see Update 4, under 1805: 15. Feldborg's departure from 
                        Britain<i> </i>near the end of the decade also matches 
                        with evidence within another of his productions, <i>A 
                        Dane's Excursions in Britain</i> (1809), written under 
                        the half-pseudonym of J. A. Andersen. In this the publisher 
                        explains the abrupt ending as follows, in an end statement 
                        dated 25 August 1809: 'Here end the "Excursions" of the 
                        Dane.-Mr. Andersen, the Author of a Tour in Zealand, the 
                        Translator of the Great and Good Danes, Norwegians, and 
                        Holsteinians, and the writer of the present volumes, has 
                        suspended his task, and made, as the Publisher must think, 
                        an excursion from Britain!' (<font size="-1">II</font>, 
                        121) Though the samplings are small, one cannot help noticing 
                        an air of amazement in statements concerning Feldborg, 
                        as if a kind of rather outrageous person was involved.</p>
                      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility 
                        from the above is that Elrington (and so Sedley) was yet 
                        another pseudonym of Feldborg's, though, if so, it hard 
                        to believe that a foreign incomer could have such a grasp 
                        of domestic scandal. Another is that Feldborg and Elrington 
                        were involved in some kind of strange collaboration, momentarily 
                        visible through the two issues of Karamzin's <i>Tales</i>. 
                        It would be useful to compare the hand written inscriptions 
                        that are to be found in the British Library copies of 
                        the 1803-issued Karamzin <i>Tales </i>(BL 12591.h.21) 
                        and <i>The Barouche Driver</i> (BL 12613.g.14), to see 
                        if there is any similarity in hand. (The inscription in 
                        the 1803 <i>Tales</i> reads: 'To Doctor William Tenant, 
                        This little volume, is, most respectfully, presented by 
                        the translator'.)<i><font size="-1"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></i></p>

                        Davenport Sedley</font><i><strong><br>
                        </strong></i></font>The activities of such an actual person, 
                        indexed there as 'blackmailer and extortionist', are described 
                        in Iain McCalman's <i>Radical Underworld: Prophets, Revolutionaries 
                        and Pornographers in London, 1795-1840</i> (Cambridge, 
                        1988; Oxford: Clarendon Press edn., 1993). By McCalman's 
                        account: 'Sedley had a vulture's instinct for corruption, 
                        and the Regent's vendetta against Princess Caroline, as 
                        well as the Duke of York's indiscretions with Mary Anne 
                        Clarke, provided him with especially rich pickings. His 
                        technique was to furnish victims with a title page and 
                        extracts from a projected book containing what he typically 
                        described as "extreamly unpleasant matter". He would then 
                        offer to have the embarrassing material suppressed or 
                        expurgated for a price' (pp. 35-6). According to McCalman, 
                        there is evidence that Sedley had United Irish affiliations, 
                        and that 'he had been sent in May 1799 from Dublin gaol 
                        to England on a warrant for swindling and embezzlement' 
                        (p. 36). (It is worth noting here that the name Elrington 
                        itself has strong Irish connotations-there was, for example, 
                        an Irish Bishop Elrington, Provost of Trinity College, 
                        Dublin-and the surname might just possibly have been adopted 
                        by Davenport Sedley as a <i>nom de guerre</i>). Considering 
                        the gravitational pull of the main Sedley scandal novels, 
                        it is also interesting find that Davenport Sedley appears 
                        to have gained access to 'The Book', concerning the 'Delicate 
                        Investigation' of Princess Caroline, no doubt making hay 
                        from this out of the establishment's desire for its suppression 
                        (see p. 42). It is just feasible, then, that the Sedley 
                        part of Charles Sedley was a true name, and that J. F. 
                        Hughes's output was more fully involved in extortion than 
                        has been realised. If so, Hughes was clearly telling at 
                        least a half-lie when claiming Sedley was a fictitious 
                        person. Granted the large body of scandal included, furthermore, 
                        it would also seem that any attempts to gain payment for 
                        suppression of materials were by no means always successful!</p>

                        </strong> The six Sedley novels reflect so much the surreptitious 
                        world of scandal-mongering at this period as well as the 
                        underhand activities of a still largely unregularised 
                        book trade that it is highly possible the mystery of Sedley's 
                        true identity will never be solved. Other possibilities 
                        exist as well as the options listed above. One is that, 
                        in spite of the projection of such a distinct author identity, 
                        these texts were put together from a variety of sources, 
                        representing in some respects a kind of pastiche. It has 
                        been discovered, for example, that a whole sequence in 
                        <em>The Faro Table</em> (see 3rd edn., <font size="-1">I</font>, 
                        105-10), feeds on an account supposedly given by a 'Femme 
                        de Chambre' in an early issue of <em>The Pic Nic</em> 
                        (vol. 1, no. 6, Saturday, 12 February, 1803, pp.&nbsp;203-8), 
                        a periodical run by a number of individuals active on 
                        the less respectable margins of London theatre life and 
                        published by J. F. Hughes. In the light of his increasing 
                        invasiveness in the later Sedley titles, it is also tempting 
                        to think that Hughes himself had a hand in creating and/or 
                        assembling materials. Certainly his own disappearance 
                        as a publisher, probably from inescapable bankruptcy, 
                        presently offers as good a reason as any for the disappearance 
                        of 'Charles Sedley'.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Two items in the second volume of <i>The 
                          English Novel, 1770-1829</i> are attributed in the author-line 
                          to either ?Radcliffe, Mary Anne or ?KER, Louisa Theresa 
                          Bellenden. These are: <i>Manfroné; or, the One-Handed 
                          Monk</i> (1809: 61) and <i>Ida of Austria; or the Knights 
                          of the Holy Cross</i> (1812: 53). The attribution of 
                          <i>Manfroné</i> to Radcliffe stems directly from its 
                          title-page, which states 'by Mary Anne Radcliffe', and 
                          in the main is followed in modern catalogues and critical 
                          studies, this work still being well known, buoyed up 
                          by a combination of its arresting title and the continuing 
                          academic appetite for the Gothic. By comparison hardly 
                          anything is known about <i>Ida of Austria</i>, and<i> 
                          </i>it is not unlikely that the Corvey copy which provides 
                          the EN2 entry is unique. The connection with Radcliffe 
                          in this case comes indirectly as a result of the title-page, 
                          which states 'by the author of "Manfrone" '. The name 
                          of Louisa Bellenden Ker, in turn, comes into play only 
                          as a result of the record of her appeals to the Royal 
                          Literary Fund. Three appeals from Ker there (RLF, 11: 
                          400, Items 6, 10, 11), written between 1822 and 1824, 
                          list 'Manfroné or the One handed Monk' as one of several 
                          works by the applicant, this particular title coming 
                          first in the list on each occasion. No mention is made 
                          of <i>Ida of Austria</i> there, however, so the association 
                          of Ker with this second novel is arrived at through 
                          the most tenuous of links.</p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported 
                          in Update 1, the issue is further complicated by the 
                          title-page attribution of the 1819 second edition of 
                          <i>Manfroné</i>, as reprinted by A. K. Newman, to 'Mary 
                          Anne Radcliffe, Author of The Mysterious Baron, &amp;c. 
                          &amp;c.' In actuality, <i>The Mysterious Baron, or the 
                          Castle in the Forest, a Gothic Story</i> (1808: 91), 
                          which was published by C. Chapple, is attributed on 
                          its own title-page to 'Eliza Ratcliffe', the dedication 
                          of this work ('to Miss Mary Ann Davies, of Fleet-Street') 
                          introducing it as 'the first essay of a female pen'. 
                          One possibility is that Newman later confused the two 
                          similar sounding names. Certainly on reading the texts 
                          there appears to be little similarity between the rather 
                          naïve-seeming Walpolian romance style of <i>The Mysterious 
                          Baron</i> and the more fraught high Gothic manner of 
                          <i>Manfroné</i>. Behind this, of course, lies the similarity 
                          of both names to Ann Radcliffe, the high priestess of 
                          Gothic romance, and the possibility that either or both 
                          were fabrications based on a desire to cash in on the 
                          latter's fame.</p>

                          a number of forays into the issue of attribution, it 
                          has not been possible to offer any fresh positive suggestions, 
                          and if anything the claims of both Mary Anne Radcliffe 
                          and Louisa Bellenden Ker have diminished, for reasons 
                          outlined below.<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>

                          given on both titles-pages) of <i>The Female Advocate; 
                          or An Attempt to Recover the Rights of Woman from Male 
                          Usurpation</i> (London: Vernor and Hood, 1799) and of 
                          <i>The Memoirs of Mrs Mary Ann Radcliffe; in Familiar 
                          Letters to a Female Friend</i> (Edinburgh: Printed for

                          1810). According to the address 'To the Reader' in <i>The 
                          Female Advocate</i>, this Wollstonecraftian study was 
                          written seven years, prior to publication, but delayed 
                          through 'timidity' and 'other hinderances'. The later 
                          <i>Memoirs</i> also states that the original intention 
                          was to publish the <i>Female Advocate</i> anonymously: 
                          'But the publisher (who at that time took a share in 
                          it) [.] strongly recommended giving my name to it. Whether, 
                          with a view to extend the sale, from the same name at

                          from whatever other motive, is best known to himself' 
                          (p. 387). As this last comment indicates, there is a 
                          clear interconnection between these two non-fictional 
                          works, the second of which offers an account ('after 
                          a life of more than three-score years') of an insecure 
                          Scottish upbringing, complicated religious loyalties, 
                          early marriage to an older and unreliable husband, struggles 
                          to survive independently with her children in London 
                          during the 1790s, and a return to live in Edinbugh <i>c.</i> 
                          1807, where charitable assistance was sought (part of 
                          the process involving the present work, which lists 
                          99 'Subscribers Names', a number from the higher echelons 
                          of Scottish society).</p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectre 
                          of uncertainty, however, enters into the equation with 
                          the fictional works that have been ascribed (or are 
                          ascribable) to Mary Anne Radcliffe, which can be seen 
                          as forming three distinct phases. Foremost here are 
                          two 1790 novels published by William Lane at the Minerva 
                          Press, both of which are given under her name in the 
                          second volume of <i>The English Novel, 1770-1829</i>, 
                          though neither supplies an author on the title-page: 
                          <i>The Fate of Velina de Guidova</i> (EN1 1790: 62) 
                          and <i>Radzivil. A Romance</i> (1790: 63). Granted that 
                          the memoirist Mary Anne Radcliffe [henceforth MAR] was 
                          in London at this time, struggling to survive independently, 
                          it is not implausible that she should undertake work 
                          for Minerva as a means of supplementing income. It should 
                          be added though that neither work gives a strong sense 
                          of an underlying author identity; and <i>Radzivil</i> 
                          in particular, ostensibly (at least) 'from the Russ[ian] 
                          of the Celebrated M. Wocklow', has several marks of 
                          being a fairly routine translation possibly from the 
                          French. The second phase of writing associated with 
                          MAR, <i>Radcliffe's New Novelist's Pocket Magazine</i> 
                          (a compilation of chapbook stories) has not been seen, 
                          but is described by Donald K. Adams as bearing the legend 
                          'The whole written, adjusted and compiled solely for 
                          this Work, By Mrs. Mary Anne Radclife, of Wimbledon 
                          in Surrey': 'The Second Mrs. Radcliffe', <i>The Mystery 
                          and Detection Annual</i> (1972), pp. 48-64 (p. 53). 
                          By Adams's account also, the first number was published 
                          in Edinburgh by Thomas Brown (though printed in London), 
                          both surviving issues are dated 1802, and amongst Gothic 
                          materials can be found in the second issue 'Monkish 
                          Mysteries; or, The Miraculous Escape'. The last 'phase' 
                          of involvement is then found with the eye-catching <i>Manfroné; 
                          or, the One-Handed Monk</i>, whose contents might seem 
                          to match the out-and-out Lewisian Gothic implied by 
                          the title 'Monkish Mysteries'. This last 'phase' is 
                          now extendable to <i>Ida of Austria</i>, though this 
                          historical romance set in the time of the Crusades has 
                          little of the Gothic in it, and in fact shows internal 
                          signs of possibly being a translation from a root German 
                          title.<font size="-1"></font></p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large 
                          resulting question as to whether it is possible to combine 
                          the MAR of the two non-fictional works with the fiction 
                          writer of all or some of phases 1-3 has never met with 
                          a fully positive answer. Even Donald K. Adams, who makes 
                          the fullest case for combination, qualifies his argument 
                          with hedging phrases at key points. Janet Todd's <i>A 
                          Dictionary of British and American Women Writers, 1660-1800</i> 
                          (1984) , noticeably<i> </i>provides two entries, one 
                          for the 'polemical writer and autobiographer' (1745?-1810?), 
                          the other for the 'novelist' (<i>fl</i>. 1790?-1809). 
                          Joanne Shattock in her <i>The Oxford Guide to British 
                          Women Writers</i> (1993) and <i>The Feminist Companion 
                          to Literature in English</i> (1990), ed. by Blain, Grundy, 
                          and Clements, both supply single entries, though with 
                          inbuilt qualifications regarding the novels involved. 
                          Isobel Grundy, author of the <i>Feminist Companion</i> 
                          entry (which also raises the possibility of Ker), has 
                          subsequently expressed the opinion to the present writer 
                          that any real connection of the novels with the memoirist 
                          is unlikely, and that the probable cause is a publishers' 
                          scam.<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 
                          this in view, it is worth reviewing the history of the 
                          attribution of the 'phase one' novels, especially as 
                          found in contemporary circulating library catalogues. 
                          In Part Two [1798] of <i>A Catalogue of the Minerva 
                          General Library</i>, held in the Bodleian Library (Don.e.218), 
                          'Velina de Guidova (the Fate of)' is listed as 'by Mrs. 
                          Radcliffe', in a way exactly comparable to 'Sicilian 
                          Romance, a Tale' on the preceding page. 'Radzivil, a 
                          Romance', however, is merely stated as being 'from the 
                          Russian of Mr. Wocklow'. In the 1814 C<i>atalogue</i> 
                          (Don.e.217) of the same library under A. K. Newman, 
                          on the other hand, we find 'Radzivil, a Romance, from 
                          the Russian of Wocklow, by Mrs. Ann Radcliffe', and 
                          'Velina de Guidova, a Novel, by the Author of the Romance 
                          of the Forest'. In other words, <i>Radzivil</i> between 
                          1798 and 1814 has been attributed to Ann Radcliffe, 
                          whereas <i>Velina de Guidova</i> has remained consistently 
                          as by her, though the means of signifying this has changed. 
                          Reinforcing the joint attribution is the appearance 
                          of both titles again in the 1814 Catalogue under the 
                          prefix 'Radcliffe's (Mrs.)', though it is also interesting 
                          to see placed there as well (along with the main Ann 
                          Radcliffe titles) both 'Manfrone, or the One-handed 
                          Monk' and 'Mysterious Baron, or the Castle in the Forest'. 
                          <i>Manfroné</i> also has its own separate entry there 
                          as 'Manfrone or the One-handed Monk, by Mrs. Radcliffe'. 
                          The now extremely rare <i>Ida of Austria</i> is likewise 
                          listed individually, but without any author being nominated. 
                          All in all no reference is made in either of these catalogues 
                          to Mary Anne Radcliffe as such. The assumption that 
                          <i>Radzivil</i> and <i>Velina de Guidova</i> are 'probably 
                          by Mrs. Mary Ann Radcliffe', made by Dorothy Blakey 
                          under the entries for those titles in her <i>The Minerva 
                          Press 1790-1820</i> (1939), pp. 150-1, and which evidently 
                          informed later attributions of these works to that author, 
                          appears to be based primarily on her own conjecture. 
                          In some fifty circulating library catalogues surveyed, 
                          no instance of an attribution to Mary Anne Radcliffe 
                          as such has been discovered in relation to this phase.<font size="-1"></font></p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
                          are also strong circumstantial reasons rejecting the 
                          idea that the memoirist MAR had any connection <i>Manfroné 
                          </i>(1809), the most obvious explanation for the appearance 
                          of her name in the titles of that novel being that it 
                          is a pseudonym. Whereas (as already suggested) it would 
                          not be implausible for MAR when in London to earn money 
                          writing for Minerva, by 1809 she was quite obviously 
                          domiciled in Edinburgh, and the placing of this work 
                          with J. F. Hughes in London would have been hard to 
                          accomplish from such a base. Nor would one expect an 
                          author seeking social acceptance, and employing the 
                          eminently respectable Manners and Miller for her <i>Memoirs</i>, 
                          to have had dealings with a publisher operating at the 
                          lower end of the fiction market. Conversely, there are 
                          number of reasons why Hughes should have enticed or 
                          bullied one of his stable of authors into featuring 
                          as Mary Anne Radcliffe. It was Hughes who in the same 
                          imprint year brought out <i>Seraphina; or A Winter in 
                          Town</i> (1809: 14), 'by Caroline Burney', evidently 
                          hoping to cash in on the genuine trademark names of 
                          Frances Burney and her half-sister Sarah Harriet Burney 
                          (Hughes's lists for 1809-10 also contained titles by 
                          'Mrs Edgeworth'). In the 'Advertisement' to Sarah Harriet 
                          Burney's <i>Traits of Nature</i> (1812: 24), Henry Colburn 
                          implicitly dissociated himself from Hughes's malpractice: 
                          'The publisher of this Work thinks it proper to state 
                          that Miss Burney is <i>not</i> the Author of a Novel 
                          called "Seraphina," published in the year 1809, under 
                          the assumed name of Caroline Burney.' <font size="-1"></font></p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stamp 
                          of J. F. Hughes is also to be traced in titles as well 
                          as author names. According to the testimony of its author, 
                          T. J. Horsley Curties, it was probably Hughes who fabricated 
                          the actual title of <i>The Monk of Udolpho</i> (1807: 
                          16), which managed to combine two of the most talismanic 
                          word in the Gothic canon. Whereas Hughes's main stock 
                          in trade had hitherto been in Monk-like Lewisian Gothic, 
                          in 1809, as Rictor Norton has reminded us, Ann Radcliffe's 
                          name was very much in the public eye, owing to reports 
                          of her madness and/or death: see <i>Mistress of Udolpho: 
                          The Life of Ann Radcliffe</i> (London and New York: 
                          Leicester University Press, 1999), pp. 212-18. Approached 
                          from the vantage point of Hughes's production of popular 
                          fiction, both the arresting title and association-filled 
                          author name of <i>Manfroné</i> have an air of predictability 
                          about them.</p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One useful 
                          pointer to how contemporary witnesses, and more particularly 
                          rival authors, might have felt has been found in <i>A 
                          Winter in Edinburgh</i> (1810: 74), published by J. 
                          Dick, and attributed on its title-page to Honoria Scott 
                          (which may or may not be a pseudonym for Susan Fraser). 
                          Matching a real-life incident in which Hughes had attempted 
                          to introduce a 'spoiler' <i>Winter at Bath</i> on the 
                          market (see notes to 1807: 7), one of the characters 
                          proposes bringing out a novel entitled 'A Winter in 
                          Wales', only to find the same title to be advertised 
                          by:</p>

                          (as seems likely) the author name in <i>Manfroné</i> 
                          is an invention aimed at producing an association with 
                          Ann Radcliffe, then records of circulating library catalogues 
                          point to the overall success of the ploy, no less than 
                          five out of eleven catalogues recently surveyed attributing 
                          the work to 'Mrs. Radcliffe' rather than the specific 
                          name actually given. In fact, the pull of Ann Radcliffe's 
                          fame seems to represent the one single element unifying 
                          the three 'phases' outlined above. However, it is perhaps 
                          not inconceivable that the compiler of <i>Radcliffe's

                          <i>Manfroné</i> are one and the same person. As for

                          </i>on internal evidence she would appear more likely 
                          to have had a hand in <i>Ida of Austria</i> rather than 
                          <i>Manfroné</i>, though the reality might be that there 
                          is no true linkage between any of these three titles.<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>

                          with the prospect of further fresh attributions following 
                          in suit. In the case of Ker (whose earlier letters to

                          Louisa Theresa Ker, and Louisa Ker) the end result is 
                          more obfuscation rather than clarification. In all Ker 
                          made eleven applications for assistance from 1819 to 
                          1836, sending lists of her publications on at least 
                          three separate occasions.</p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 
                          first of these applications, dated 26 October 1819 (RLF 
                          11: 400, Item 1), it is noticeable that Ker makes no 
                          mention of <i>Manfroné</i>, in spite of its having been 
                          first published in 1809 and reprinted by Newman in 1819. 
                          Instead she refers only to 'a small volume of Tales 
                          from the French of Bernadin St Pierre', for which a 
                          publisher could not be found, and translations of two 
                          French plays, 'Bermicide or the Fatal Offspring' and 
                          'the Brazen Bust', for which, though performed at Drury 
                          Lane and Covent Garden theatres respectively, she had 
                          not received due credit. The bulk of this letter is 
                          taken up in outlining her personal credentials, as 'the 
                          only surviving daughter of the late Dr Lewis Ker of 
                          the College of Physicians', dashed expectations of becoming 
                          'the heiress of the noble family whose name I bear', 
                          and parlous situation after the death of her mother. 
                          The names of 'Mr Chapple, Circulating Library, Pall 
                          Mall' and 'Mr Woodfall, Printer to the College, Dean's 
                          Yard, Westminster' are given as suitable additional 
                          referees, and Ker's address in this letter is given 
                          as 3 Britannia- Street, Westminster Road, Lambeth. In 
                          1822 she made her second application, this time adding 
                          a list, having been informed that the first donation 
                          had been approved on the merits of her father. This 
                          list (Item 6) gives the following 'published novels

                          applauded dramatick pieces', but mentions nothing else.

                          in April and November 1824. The first (Item 10) brings 
                          into play 'Dangerous Connections translation 3 vol.' 
                          and 'Indian Cottage d[itt]o from St Pierre', as well 
                          as three extra plays performed 'at Covent Garden and 
                          the Cobourg Theatres' (one of which is 'Ruins of Babylon'). 
                          The second (Item 11), a cut-down version, still features 
                          'Manfroné', while adding 'Theodore or the Child of the 
                          Forest Romance in four volumes'. This last list is introduced 
                          by the qualification that 'most [.] are now out of print, 
                          and others have never been published'. No mention is 
                          made at any point of <i>The Mysterious Baron</i>.<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 
                          surface of things, it is quite feasible that Ker delayed 
                          claiming novels (with their less salubrious reputation) 
                          until forced to by the Committee's regulations. A major 
                          problem nevertheless exists with the titles eventually 
                          supplied, not least since several are attributable to 
                          other writers. <i>Aurora, or the Mysterious Beauty</i> 
                          (1803: 29), for instance, based on the <i>Aurora, ou 
                          l'amant mystérieuse</i> (1802) of J.-J.-M. Duperche, 
                          is described on its title-page as 'Taken from the French. 
                          By Camilla Dufour'. Dufour herself was a popular singer 
                          at Drury Lane, and married to J. H. Sarratt, who himself 
                          is the acknowledged translator of a chapbook version 
                          of <i>Koenigsmark</i>, from the German of Raspe, another 
                          title listed by Ker. <i>The Swiss Emigrants: A Tale</i> 
                          (1804: 52) was almost certainly by the Scottish author 
                          Hugh Murray: in fact, the Longman Divide Ledger entry 
                          for this title (CD, p. 178) itemises payment of £10 
                          to 'Mr Murray'. Perhaps significantly, too, P. Boulanger 
                          when called into service again in 1826 could only vouch 
                          for 'the Brazen Bust, Ruins of Babylon and several other 
                          dramatick pieces' (Item 14). One also wonders why Ker 
                          never used her own name in any of the above claimed 
                          novels, especially in view of her sympathy-inducing 
                          situation and alleged aristocratic connections (a valuable 
                          point of comparison is provided by her namesake Anne 
                          Ker: see especially John Steele's 'Anne and John Ker: 
                          New Soundings', <i>Cardiff Corvey: Reading the Romantic 
                          Text</i> 12 (Summer 2004). Online: Internet: &lt;<i>http://www.cf.ac.uk/encap/corvey/articles/cc12_n03.html</i>&gt;).</p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further 
                          insight has been gained through the discovery by Sharon 
                          Ragaz of two reports evidently concerning Ker in <i>The 
                          Morning Chronicle</i>. The first, in the issue for 17 
                          October 1823, concerns a trial for petty theft, the 
                          accused being Louisa Bellenden Kerr [<i>sic</i>] and 
                          another woman. Kerr or Ker described herself as distantly 
                          related to the Duke of Roxburgh (whose family name was 
                          Ker) and allied to other important figures. Her father 
                          she identified as a friend of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, 
                          and she made other claims about his status, saying he 
                          was librarian to the Royal College of Physicians. The 
                          court seemed to think there was enough evidence (or 
                          lack thereof) to consider these things unlikely and 
                          that she was a professional criminal. Although Kerr 
                          said that she had turned to other means of obtaining 
                          a livelihood because all attempts to support herself 
                          by honest means had failed, she appears to have made 
                          no mention to the court of being a dramatist or novelist; 
                          neither did she claim to have published any works. Kerr 
                          was remanded into custody pending a further court appearance 
                          and an investigation of her circumstances by the Mendicity 
                          Society.</p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Morning 
                          Chronicle</i> of 22 October 1823 carries a further notice 
                          on Kerr's second court appearance, at which an official 
                          from the Mendicity Society was in evidence. The official 
                          had viewed Kerr's apparently squalid place of abode, 
                          where a number of letters were found. It was determined 
                          that Kerr carried on an expert trade in writing 'begging 
                          letters', a trade at which her mother was said to be 
                          even more expert. By claiming relationship to various 
                          people, she had received payments of small sums (£5 
                          or so) from them. The newspaper notes that her case 
                          excited considerable interest because of her supposed 
                          aristocratic connections; however, the court determined 
                          that these had no basis in reality. Her claims about 
                          her father's profession are also stated to have been 
                          investigated and found to be untrue. She is described 
                          as a 'swindler'. Nevertheless, the grim circumstances 
                          of her living conditions were taken into account, and 
                          while the other woman was dismissed without further 
                          charge, Kerr was sent home to her parish (not identified) 
                          and urged to abandon the life she had adopted.</p>
                        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, 
                          there remains the possibility that Ker was being unfairly 
                          maligned: one of the RLF letters of 1824 (Item 10) refers 
                          to her as being 'the victim of unjust and malicious 
                          accusations'. Moreover, even if direct authorship is 
                          highly unlikely, a valuable insight into the general 
                          atmosphere that helped create <i>Manfroné</i> might 
                          still be found in the theatrical world conveyed by these 
                          appeals, a world from which J. F. Hughes drew a number 
                          of his authors. On the fuller front, however, the case 
                          of Louisa Bellenden Ker probably takes us no further 
                          in identifying an actual novel-writing 'Mary Anne Radcliffe'.</p>
