                        Prose Fiction published in the British Isles</i>, general 
                        editors Peter Garside, James Raven, and Rainer Schöwerling, 
                        2 vols (Oxford: OUP, 2000). In particular it offers fresh 
                        commentary on the entries in the second volume, which 
                        was co-edited by Peter Garside and Rainer Schöwerling, 
                        with the assistance of Christopher Skelton-Foord and Karin 
                        Wünsche. The present report is the third Update in what 
                        is intended to be a series of annual Reports, each featuring 
                        information that has come to light in the preceding year 
                        as a result of activities in CEIR and through contributions 
                        sent by interested individuals outside Cardiff.</p>
                      <p align="justify">The entries below are organised in a 
                        way that matches the order of material in the <i>English 
                        Novel, 1770-1829</i>. While making reference to any relevant 
                        changes that may have occurred in Updates 1 and 2, the 
                        'base' it refers to is the printed Bibliography and not 
                        the preceding reports. Sections A and B concern authorship, 
                        with the first of these proposing changes to the attribution 
                        as given in the printed Bibliography, and the second recording 
                        the discovery of new information of interest that has 
                        nevertheless not led presently to new attributions. Section 
                        C includes three additional titles which match the criteria 
                        for inclusion and should ideally have been incorporated 
                        in the printed Bibliography, while the last two sections 
                        involve information such as is usually found in the <i>Notes</i> 
                        field of entries, and those owning copies of the printed 
                        Bibliography might wish (as in the case of the earlier 
                        categories) to amend entries accordingly. An element of 
                        colour coding has been used to facilitate recognition 
                        of the nature of changes, with <font color="#990033">red</font> 
                        denoting revisions and additions to existing entries in 
                        the Bibliography, and the additional titles discovered 
                        being picked out in <font color="#4476B5">blue</font>. 
                        Reference numbers (e.g. 1806: 12) are the same as those 
                        in the <i>English Novel, 1770-1829</i>; when found as 
                        cross references these refer back to the original Bibliography, 
                        unless accompanied with 'above' or 'below', in which case 
                        a cross reference within the present report is intended. 
                        Abbreviations match those listed at the beginning volume 
                        2 of the <i>English Novel,</i> though in a few cases these 
                        are spelled out more fully for the convenience of present 
                        readers.</p>
                      <p align="justify">This report was prepared by Peter Garside, 
                        with significant inputs of information from Drs Jacqueline 
                        Belanger and Sharon Ragaz, on this occasion especially 
                        as a result of their trawls through (respectively) the 
                        Longman Letter Books and Blackwood Papers. Additional 
                        information was provided by Dr Anthony Mandal, who was 
                        also responsible for preparing the report in its final 
                        form via the <i>Cardiff Corvey </i>website. Information 
                        was also generously communicated by a number of individuals, 
                        notably: Professors Rolf Loeber and Magda Stouthamer-Loeber, 
                        from Pittsburgh University, and Timothy Killick at Cardiff 
                        University. As previously the Cardiff team has benefited 
                        from its association with Projekt Corvey at Paderborn 
                        University, most recently through the joint preparation 
                        of a Bibliography of Fiction, 1830-1836 (also included 
                        in Issue 10 of <i>Cardiff Corvey</i>). Thanks are also 
                        due to Michael Bott, of Reading University Library, for 
                        help received in locating materials in the Longman archives; 
                        and to the trustees of the National Library of Scotland

                        <i>Notes</i>. A draft letter to William Hack of 1 Aug 
                        1822 in the Longman Letter Books reads: 'On the other 
                        side you have the opinion of our literary friend respecting 
                        the Novel you sent us. As it is the first production of 
                        the Author we requested our friend to go into detail &amp; 
                        if she will make the proposed alterations, we shall be 
                        happy to see the MS again, when it is very likely we shall 
                        engage in the publication. The MS is forwarded by this 
                        nights coach' (Longman I, 101, no. 311A). <font color="black">The 
                        letter is addressed to Hack at </font>Market St., Brighton<font color="black">. 
                        The Longman Divide Ledger entry for this novel indicates 
                        a balance due to 'Mrs Hack' of £7. 8. 6 (dated 1 Feb 1825): 
                        this points to the likelihood that <i>Reformation</i> 
                        was the work of the wife or a female relation of William 
                        Hack. It might even be possible to attribute the novel 
                        to Maria Barton Hack (1777-1844), a prolific writer of 
                        children's literature, though her first work<i>, Winter 
                        Evenings: or Tales of Travellers</i>, appeared in 1818. 
                        Mention of the present item being 'a first work' is made 
                        in another letter to William Hack, evidently later in 
                        1822, sending further recommendations from the reader 
                        and returning the MS (no. 296B).</font><font color="#990033"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>

                        concerning terms, makes no mention of any other author: 
                        'Agreeably to my promise I have examined the MS of "Hirstwood" 
                        [<i>sic</i>] and the house is willing to engage in the 
                        speculation on the terms I explained to you-namely, that 
                        the house should be at the expense &amp; risk of Paper, 
                        Printing &amp;c &amp;c and that the profits of the first 
                        &amp; future editions be divided equally with the author-you 
                        will please to inform me if the terms are agreed to, as 
                        the Work should appear as early as possible' (Longman 
                        I, 101, no. 381A) The letter is addressed to French at 
                        Westbury, near Bristol. It is also perhaps significant 
                        that other works commonly attributed to Ashworth were 
                        published in the 1850s or later.</font></p>

                        the Revd Charles William Chalklen or his sister. In the 
                        first of these, dated 5 Sept 1827, Chalklen urges William 
                        Blackwood for a response to manuscripts sent: 'It is odd 
                        I shd not yet have heard from you anything of ye "Hebrew" 
                        now in your hands-at least in your house. It is by a Lady 
                        and my Sister [.] I must hear from you a decisive answer 
                        as to whether you will risque ye publication of ye //

                        // in one volume' (NLS, MS 4019, f. 27). This letter gives 
                        Chalklen's address as Kingstead, near Thrapston, Northants. 
                        Chalklen's statement that 'The Hebrew' is the work of 
                        his sister is repeated in a similar letter of 1 Nov 1827 
                        (f. 29), which refers to 'The "Hebrew" a Tale by my Sister-in 
                        my handwriting'; but any authorship other than that by 
                        the sender appears to receive sceptical treatment in the 
                        reader's report sent by David Macbeth Moir to Blackwood 
                        on 3 Oct 1827: 'I return you Charles Chalklands [<i>sic</i>] 
                        alias Williamson, alias --s MSS which I have carefully 
                        read over' (MS 4020, f. 39). No mention of a sister can 
                        be found in two letters from Chalklen's father, on 8 Jan 
                        and 11 Mar 1828, concerning what appears to be a private 
                        financing of 'The Hebrew' with Blackwood handling the 
                        public launch (MS 4021, ff. 84, 86). Altogether it is 
                        not clear whether <i>The Hebrew</i> was primarily written 
                        by Chalker's sister (whose surname might then of course 
                        have been different), or by Chalklen himself, though the 
                        latter is perhaps more likely. Charles William Chalklen's 
                        acknowledged works include <i>Babylon, a Poem</i> (1821) 
                        and <i>Semiramis, an Historical Morality, and Other Poems</i>

                        (1814: 46), states: 'There is a good deal of Miss Watson

                        on record of having at least dabbled with fiction at this

                        CAVALIER. A ROMANCE. NSTC in listing the Philadelphia 
                        1822 edn held at Harvard notes: 'sometimes attributed 
                        Thomas Roscoe junior'. Two further 'Bennet' titles, <i>The 
                        King of the Peak</i> (1823: 23) and <i>Owain Goch</i> 
                        (1827: 16), are given in DNB and CBEL3 as by Thomas Roscoe 
                        (1791-1871), the son of William Roscoe. The dedication 
                        of <i>The King of the Peak</i> to the Mayor of Liverpool 
                        might also seem to promote the idea of a Roscoe / Liverpool 
                        connection. Furthermore, several of the letters addressed 
                        to William Bennett Esq in the Longman archives appear 
                        at points to indicate that he is the agent rather than 
                        actual author. See, for example, the firm's letter of 
                        7 Jan 1823: 'If your friend can fix on any other good 
                        title, it may be as well not to take that of "King of 
                        the Peak": for, though it may be explained away in the 
                        Preface, at first it will be considered as an adoption 
                        of part of the title of Peverell of the Peak' (Letter 
                        Books, Longman I, 101, no. 338). On the other hand, there 
                        can be no denying the Derbyshire credentials of this set 
                        of novels; and, in this particular instance, the author 
                        responded in his Preface by asserting that 'there are 
                        many respectable gentlemen in the county of Derby, who 
                        can bear witness that I intended publishing this work 
                        under the title it bears, before there was any annunciation 
                        of Peveril of the Peak' (vol. 1, p. xvi). Especially telling 
                        in this regard is the family copy described in Wolff (vol. 
                        1, p. 71; Item 385), with a note laid in saying 'These 
                        books were written by my great grandfather William Bennet 
                        under the pseudonym Lee Gibbons'. One possible solution 
                        for the Longman letters might be that Bennet's father, 
                        another William, was acting on behalf of his trainee lawyer 
                        son. Alternatively a precocious younger Bennet could have 
                        been successfully juggling the roles of author and agent 
                        himself. Is there evidence of a family of Derbyshire lawyers 
                        in Chapel-en-le-Frith (the place given in the Dedication 
                        of 1821: 22)?</p>

                        No novels by Mrs Blair have so far been identified, though 
                        the date of Edgeworth's letter perhaps opens up the possibility 
                        of collaboration with her daughter on <i>Zeal and Experience</i>

                        also precede main narrative, which itself commences on 
                        p. [3]. Engraved frontispiece, plus six other plates interleaved 
                        in text, all save one (undated) bearing the date 1829. 
                        Evidently published first in numbers. Collates in fours.<br>

                        THE RULING PASSION, A COMIC STORY, OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. 
                        Further information about this title has arisen through 
                        a letter addressed to 'Allson &amp; Sidney' in the Longman 
                        Letter Books. Dated 30 Dec 1820, this reads: 'We wish 
                        you had sent us a copy of Ruling Passion. If we are not 
                        mistaken it is a translation either from the French or 
                        Italian. We have no objection to publish the work for 
                        you on the usual terms we do such matters-to account for 
                        the books we may sell at the Trade Sale price &amp; charge 
                        a commission of 10 P Cent on the sales, you paying all 
                        the expenses of Advertising, freight, &amp;c. // Have 
                        you not been too sanguine of its sale having printed 2000 
                        copies?' (Longman I, 101, no. 70). It is likely that Allison 
                        &amp; Sidney are 'the Proprietors of the Hull Packet [a 
                        weekly newspaper]', for whom the novel was printed. Mention 
                        of the work being a translation also helps explain the 
                        presumably facetious 'revived, revised, and edited' incorporated 
                        in the fuller title. OCCL (accession no. 8634631) identifies 
                        this work as based on <i>La Fuerza de la sangre</i> of 
                        Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, which itself had been translated 
                        into English as <i>The Prevalence of Blood</i> (London, 
                        1729), and again, more recently, as <i>The Force of Blood, 
                        A Novel</i> (London, Printed for the translator, by T. 
                        Gillet, 1800). No copy of this work with Longmans included 
                        in the imprint has been discovered, though it is possible 
                        that the firm helped in the remaindering of what is almost 
                        certainly correctly perceived to be an over-large impression<font color="black">.</font></p>
