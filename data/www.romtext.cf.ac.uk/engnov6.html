                      <p align="justify">This report, like its predecessors, relates  primarily to the second volume of <em>The English Novel, 1770&ndash;1829: A  Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fiction published in the British Isles</em> (Oxford: OUP, 2000), co-edited by Peter Garside and Rainer Sch&ouml;werling, with  the assistance of Christopher Skelton-Foord and Karin W&uuml;nsche. On the present  occasion, however, it also refers to the online <em>The English Novel 1830&ndash;36</em> (<a href="http://www.cf.ac.uk/encap/corvey/1830s">http://<em>www.cf.ac.uk/encap/corvey/1830s</em></a>),  which effectively serves as a continuation of the printed bibliography. As in  earlier reports, the input derives generally from the activities of the  research team who helped produce&nbsp; the  database <em>The British Novel 1800&ndash;1829: A Database of Production, Circulation  &amp; Reception</em> (http://<em>www.british-fiction.cf.ac.uk</em>), first made  publicly available in 2004, the members of which are listed at the head above.</p>
                      <p align="justify"> The entries below are organised in a way that matches the  order of material as supplied in <em>The</em> <em>English Novel, 1770&ndash;1829</em>.  While making reference to any relevant changes that may have occurred in  previous Updates, the &lsquo;base&rsquo; it refers to is the printed Bibliography and not  the preceding reports. Sections A and B concern authorship, the first of these  proposing changes to attributions as given in the printed Bibliography, and the  second recording the discovery of new information of interest that has nevertheless  not led presently to new attributions. Section C includes one additional novel  (though not seen), which appears to match the criteria for inclusion and should  ideally have been incorporated in the printed Bibliography. Section D lists a  title already in the Bibliography for which a surviving copy could not  previously be located, while the last two sections (E and F) involve  information such as is usually found in the <em>Notes</em> field of entries. As  previously, those owning copies of the printed Bibliography might wish to amend  entries accordingly. An element of colour coding has been used to facilitate  recognition of the nature of changes, with <span class="red">red</span> denoting revisions and additions to existing entries in the Bibliography, and  the additional title discovered being picked out in <font color="#4476B5">blue</font>.  Reference numbers (e.g. 1801: 60) are the same as those in the <em>English  Novel, 1770&ndash;1829</em> and in its 1830&ndash;36 online continuation; abbreviations  match those listed at the beginning of volume 2 of the <em>English Novel,</em> though in a few cases these are spelled out more fully for the convenience of  present readers. </p>
                      <p align="justify">This report was prepared by  Peter Garside, with a significant input of information in the present instance  from Dr Sharon Ragaz. Other informants, to whom the main compiler is grateful,  include Ross Belson, Michael Gamer, Peter Keelan, Don Shelton, and Zsuzsanna  Varga. Special thanks are due to Maximiliaan van Woudenberg for allowing the  link to his video illustrating the transnational nature of the stories in <em>Tales  of the Dead</em> (1813: 60); and to Angela Esterhammer for allowing  pre-publication access to her article identifying the true authorship of <em>Andrew  of Padua</em> (see 1820: 24)                      </p>

                      <em>Notes</em>. Mainly translated and adapted from of <em>Fantasmagoriana,  ou recueil d&rsquo;histoires, d&rsquo;apparitions de spectres, revenants [...] traduit de  l&rsquo;allemand, par un Amateur</em> [by Jean Baptiste Benoit Eyri&egrave;s] (Paris, 1812).  &lsquo;Advertisement&rsquo;, pp. [i]&ndash;ii, states: &lsquo;The first four tales in this collection,  and the last, are imitated from a small French work, which professes to be  translated from the German [...] The last tale has been considerably curtailed  [...] The fifth tale [...] is founded on an incident similar in its features,  which was some years since communicated to me, by a female friend of very deserved  celebrity&rsquo;. &lsquo;Preface of the French Translator&rsquo;, pp. [iii]&ndash;viii. Six tales in  all: <span class="red">&lsquo;The Family Portraits&rsquo;, [3]&ndash;63; &lsquo;The Fated  Hour&rsquo;, [64]&ndash;93; &lsquo;The Death&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;, [94]&ndash;120; &lsquo;The Death-Bride&rsquo;, [121]&ndash;177;  &lsquo;The Storm&rsquo;, [178]&ndash;192; &lsquo;The Spectre Barber&rsquo;, [193]&ndash;248</span>. In the  Introduction to the 1831 edn. of her <em>Frankenstein</em>, Mary Shelley  mentions that a reading of the French version of this work in the company of  Byron, Polidori and Percy B. Shelley, in Italy in 1816, prompted their decision  to write ghost stories. <span class="red">A German source for the  French <em>Fantasmagoriana</em> of 1812, and authorial origin for four of the  tales in the present work, is described in Terry Hale&rsquo;s Introduction to his  edition of <em>Tales of the Dead: The Ghost Stories of the Villa Diodati</em> (Chislehurst, 1992). According to Hale&rsquo;s account, Friedrich Schulze was the  author of three of the stories in <em>Tales of the Dead</em> (&lsquo;The Fated Hour&rsquo;,  &lsquo;The Death&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;, and &lsquo;The Death-Bride&rsquo;), these being published in the first  two vols. of the 5-vol. <em>Gespensterbuch</em> (Leipzig, 1811&ndash;15), which was  jointly edited by Schulze (under the pseudonym of Friedrich Laun) and the  playwright Johann Apel. Another story in <em>Tales of the Dead</em> (&lsquo;The  Spectre Barber&rsquo;), also published in the <em>Gespensterbuch</em>, is identified  as by the veteran German author Johann Karl August Mus&auml;us. Further information  is available through Maximiliaan van Woudenberg&rsquo;s digitial narrative on the <em>Fantasmagoriana</em> (<em><a href="http://www.linkemik.com/scholar.html">http://www.linkemik.com/scholar.html</a></em>).</span></p>

In the same article, Esterhammer identifies the source of the  second tale as &lsquo;Claudia y Don Lorenzo&rsquo;, one of several inset stories in the  9-vol. novel <em>La Leandra</em> written by the Spanish Enlightenment writer  Antonio Valladeres de Sotomayor (1738&ndash;1820), and published in Madrid 1797&ndash;1807;  she also speculates whether John Galt might have been the translator in this  case.</span>                      </p>

Mrs. George Chapple Norton &ndash; afterwards STIRLING-MAXWELL, Lady [&hellip;] 1808&ndash;1877.&rsquo;  None of the other NSTC records list the 1832 edition under Norton&rsquo;s name, and  the attribution must be regarded as questionable. It is generally understood  that between early 1830 with the publication of her long poem &lsquo;The Undying One&rsquo;  and 1835, when her 3-vol. <em>The Wife and Woman&rsquo;s Reward</em> (1835: 72)  appeared, Caroline Norton&rsquo;s work consisted only of poems and short stories  published in magazines. </p>

                      <p align="justify"><strong>1801: 60 </strong>SICKELMORE, Richard, RAYMOND, A NOVEL.  &lsquo;List of Subscribers&rsquo; (as reported in Update 5) now seen copy in Library at  University of California, Berkeley (PR.5452.S16.R3.1801), Vol. 1, pp.  [vii]&ndash;xii. lists 135 subscribers, amongst whom 48 are females, subscribing for  141 copies. Headed by &lsquo;His Royal Highness the PRINCE of WALES&rsquo;, the list  includes a high proportion of aristocrats, including Duchess of Beaufort, Duke  of Marlborough, and Lord Holland. &lsquo;Mrs Fitzherbert&rsquo;, placed fairly high up the  alphabetical ordering, under Lady Henry Fitzroy and Hon. Miss Flower, may  possibly refer to the Prince&rsquo;s companion/wife. </p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1808:  63</strong> HURSTONE, J. P., THE PICCADILLY AMBULATOR; OR, OLD Q: CONTAINING MEMOIRS OF  THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THAT EVER-GREEN VOTARY OF VENUS! THROUGHOUT WHICH ARE  INTERSPERSED ANECDOTES OF THE MOST NOTED FASHIONABLES, HIS CONTEMPORARIES. Title  at foot of folding coloured  illustration reads &lsquo;A View taken from the Green [not &lsquo;Grand&rsquo;] Park&rsquo;. (Verified  from private copy.)</p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1822: 76</strong> TROTTER, Robert, LOWRAN CASTLE, OR THE  WILD BOAR OF CURRIDOO: WITH OTHER TALES, ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE SUPERSTITIONS,  MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS OF GALLOWAY. The BL copy at RB.23.b.12566 (as reported in  Update 5), containing &lsquo;Subscribers&rsquo; Names&rsquo;, pp. [159]&ndash;168, now seen. Lists 273  subscribers, amongst whom just 14 are females, with 288 copies in all subscribed.  Alphabetical listing arranges gentry and those in professional class (military,  medical, clergy) above often long lists under the title &lsquo;Messrs&rsquo;. Includes  place names throughout, with main concentration in SW Scotland, but with  significant input from NW England, and other towns in England. Noticeably also  included are &lsquo;Robert Gillespie, Esq. of New York&rsquo; and &lsquo;James Simpson, Geneva,  New York&rsquo;. A family connection (possibly the author&rsquo;s father) is suggested by  &lsquo;John Trotter, Esq. surgeon, Worsley Mills, two copies&rsquo;.</p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1825:  26</strong> DE RENZY, {S.} Sparow, LIFE, LOVE, AND POLITICS; OR THE ADVENTURES OF A NOVICE. A TALE. Burmester Catalogue 65  (2006), Item 108, describes copy with list of subscribers, accounting for 30  copies; with the Earl and Countess of Cavan, and Sir Hussey and Lady Vivian,  prominent among the subscribers. BL copy (N.300) rechecked, and lacks this  list. One additional feature, previously not noted, is the colophon of Thomas  Baker, Printer, Southampton, in both volumes.</p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1828: 23 </strong>[BRISTOW, Amelia], EMMA DE LISSAU; A  NARRATIVE OF STRIKING VICISSITUDES, AND PECULIAR TRIALS; WITH EXPLANATORY  NOTES, ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE JEWS. Second edition  (private copy), 1829, contains extended &lsquo;List of Subscribers&rsquo;(10 pp. unn.),  with extra details alongside some names (384 copies subscribed).</p>

                      <p align="justify"><strong>1807: 15 </strong>COTTIN, [Sophie Ristaud]; MEEKE,  [Mary] (<em>trans</em>.), ELIZABETH; OR, THE EXILES OF SIBERIA. A TALE, FOUNDED  ON FACTS. The same-year issue published by Appleyard, as reported in Update 5,  has now been seen at Glasgow University Library (Sp.Coll.Z6-1.22). Title reads  ELIZABETH; OR THE EXILES OF SIBERIA, A TALE, FOUNDED UPON FACTS. FROM THE  FRENCH OF MAD. COTTIN; and imprint reads &lsquo;London: Printed for Appleyard,  Wimpole Street; Oddy and Co. 27, Oxford Street; and W. Oddy, 108, Newgate  Street, 1807&rsquo;. Printer&rsquo;s mark on title-page reads: &lsquo;Burton, Printer, 82, Fetter  Lane&rsquo;. &lsquo;The Author&rsquo;s Preface&rsquo; (3pp. unn.), followed by &lsquo;Translator&rsquo;s Address&rsquo;  (1p. unn.); main text 254p (12mo in sixes). Leaf advertising &lsquo;Books Just  Published and Sold by Oddy and Co.&rsquo; at end. Evidently a different translation  from 1807: 15; and, if discovered in time, would have warranted full entry as  1807: 15(b).</p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1814: 16</strong> CULLEN, Margaret, MORNTON A NOVEL. The  Ricky Carter Collection Donation, Special Collections and Archives, Cardiff  University Library, includes a copy bearing &lsquo;Second Edition&rsquo; on the title-page,  and with imprint date of 1815. In other respects, the imprint details are the  same as on the first edition, as is also the case with the colophon. This  edition presumably fills in the gap between the first edition and the third  edition of 1829 noted in the Bibliography.</p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1823: 38</strong> [GLEIG, George Robert],THE STRANGER&rsquo;S  GRAVE. Richard Beaton, Catalogue 42 (2006) records Allen, 1846 reprint, 144  pp., titled &lsquo;The Stranger&rsquo;s Grave, or the Maiden&rsquo;s Doom. By H. Villiers, Esq. A  Tale of Illicit Love, Founded Upon Facts&rsquo;.</p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1824: 31</strong> DURAS, [Claire Louise Rose Bonne, Duchesse  de], OURIKA. Entries a) and b) in the Bibliography describe different  translation with 1824 imprints published by, respectively, James Cawthorn and  Longman &amp; Co. James Burmester, Catalogue 71 (2008), Item 125, describes  another edition published with same year London imprint of J. Robins, 12mo,  100pp, this copy bearing the distinctive ownership inscription on title of  George Cruikshank, 1824. If discovered in time, this might have warranted full  entry as 1824: 31(c).</p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1827: 44</strong> [JOHNSTONE, Christian Isobel],  ELIZABETH DE BRUCE. Ian Duncan, in his <em>Scott&rsquo;s Shadow: The Novel in  Romantic Edinburgh</em> (Princeton and Oxford, 2007), p. 346, n. 9, points to a  German version &lsquo;nach Walter Scott&rsquo; (3 vols; Stuttgart, 1827). As he notes, this  matches the earlier attribution of the Johnstone&rsquo;s <em>Clan-Albin</em> to  Scott, as already noted in the Bibliography (1815: 32).                      </p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>1828: 57 </strong>MANZONI, Alessandro; [SWAN, Charles (<em>trans</em>.)],  THE BETROTHED LOVERS; A MILANESE TALE OF THE XVIIth.  CENTURY. Entry in Bibliography describes BL copy with Pisa imprint of Nicolo  Capurro, 1828; but notes also that ECB lists Rivington as publisher, adding  that this indicates a full circulation in Britain (providing justification for  inclusion of a non British and Irish imprint). Jarndyce Catalogue, CLXXX (Winter 2008&ndash;09), Item 258,  describes a copy with London imprint, &lsquo;Printed for C. and J. Rivington&rsquo;,  establishing fully that this first English edition (evidently a joint  production with the Italian publisher) was also issued fully in Britain. </p>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>[1830] Appendix 2 B: 3 </strong>{BENNET, W[illia]m} [originally BENNOCH], TRAITS  OF SCOTTISH LIFE, AND PICTURES OF SCENES AND CHARACTER. A copy bearing &lsquo;Second  Edition&rsquo; on the titles has been found (private copy), with the same &lsquo;Whittaker,  Treacher, &amp; Co.&rsquo; London imprint, but with the date 1832. This shows signs  of being a reissue of old sheets with a replacement title-page.</p>
