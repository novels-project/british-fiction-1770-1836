                        of Prose Fiction published in the British Isles</i>, general 
                        editors Peter Garside, James Raven, and Rainer Sch&ouml;werling, 
                        2 vols. (Oxford: OUP, 2000). In particular it offers fresh 
                        commentary on the entries in the second volume, which 
                        was co-edited by Peter Garside and Rainer Sch&ouml;werling, 
                        with the assistance of Christopher Skelton-Foord and Karin 
                        W&uuml;nsche. The present report represents the fifth 
                        and last Update in what was intended to be a series of 
                        annual Reports, each featuring information that has come 
                        to light in the preceding year as a result of activities 
                        in CEIR and through contributions sent by interested individuals 
                        outside Cardiff.</p>
                      <p align="justify"> The entries below are organised in a 
                        way that matches the order of material in the <i>English 
                        Novel, 1770&#8211;1829</i>. While making reference to 
                        any relevant changes that may have occurred in previous 
                        Updates, the &#8216;base&#8217; it refers to is the printed 
                        Bibliography and not the preceding reports. Sections A 
                        and B concern authorship, the first of these proposing 
                        a change to the attribution as given in the printed Bibliography, 
                        and the second recording the discovery of new information 
                        of interest that has nevertheless not led presently to 
                        new attributions. Section C includes one additional novel 
                        (though not seen), which appears to match the criteria 
                        for inclusion and should ideally have been incorporated 
                        in the printed Bibliography. Section D lists a title already 
                        in the Bibliography for which a surviving copy could not 
                        be previously found, while the last two sections (E and 
                        F) involve information such as is usually found in the 
                        <i>Notes</i> field of entries. As previously, those owning 
                        copies of the printed Bibliography might wish to amend 
                        entries accordingly. An element of colour coding has been 
                        used to facilitate recognition of the nature of changes, 
                        with <font color="#990033">red</font> denoting revisions 
                        and additions to existing entries in the Bibliography, 
                        and the additional title discovered being picked out in 
                        blue. Reference numbers (e.g. 1805: 10) are the same as 
                        those in the <i>English Novel, 1770&#8211;1829</i>; abbreviations 
                        match those listed at the beginning volume 2 of the <i>English 
                        Novel</i>, though in a few cases these are spelled out 
                        more fully for the convenience of present readers. EN3 
                        refers to the online <i>The English Novel 1830&#8211;36</i>

                        to the apparent attribution of this novel to Lady Crespigny 
                        in J. Brown&#8217;s Circulating Library in Wigan, as reported 
                        in Update 4, advertisements have been found in the <i>Morning

                        by Lady Crespigny&#8217;. This evidently formed part of 
                        a marketing ploy, however, and no mention of any such 
                        direct assistance is found in the ultra-respectful Dedication

                        Lady Mary Champion de Crespigny (1748?<i>&#8211;</i>1812), 
                        n&eacute;e Mary Clarke, is one of most commonly-found 
                        persons in subscription lists to novels early in the 19th 
                        century. Apart from writing <i>The Pavilion. A Novel</i> 
                        (EN1 1796: 35), she was also the acknowledged author of 
                        <i>A Monody to the Memory of the Right Honourable the

                        review in the <i>Flowers of Literature</i> for 1806 identifies 
                        the author as the same Mrs Temple whose <i>Poems</i> it 
                        had reviewed in 1805: &#8216;Her preface is here signed 
                        F. Temple: the <i>Poems</i> appeared under the name of 
                        Laura Sophia Temple&#8217; (p. 502). The title is also 
                        mentioned in an introductory section on &#8216;Novelists&#8217; 
                        in the same issue of the journal: &#8216;Mrs. Temple, 
                        the fair author of some excellent poems, of which we took 
                        ample notice in our preceding volume, has produced a ponderous 
                        novel, in five volumes, entitled <i>Ferdinand Fitzormond</i>&#8217; 
                        (p. lxxvii). The combined attribution also gains credence 
                        in view of all three works involved, <i>Flowers of Literature</i>, 
                        <i>Ferdinand Fitzormond</i>, and <i>Poems</i> (1805), 
                        being issued by the same publisher, viz. Richard Phillips. 
                        On the other hand, according to J. R. de J. Jackson&#8217;s 
                        <i>Romantic Poetry by Women: A Bibliography, 1770&#8211;1835</i> 
                        (1993), pp. 346&#8211;47, Laura Sophia Temple (1763&#8211;after 
                        1820) was married to Samuel B. Sweetman, which does not 
                        accord with the initial &#8216;F&#8217;. as found in the 
                        &#8216;Advertisement&#8217; to <i>Ferdinand Fitzormond</i>. 
                        There may, however, be some significance in Temple&#8217;s 
                        mother, the wife of Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Temple, 
                        being named Frances. The address &#8216;To the Reader&#8217; 
                        in <i>Poems</i> (1805) is dated &#8216;Chelsea, Dec. 16,

                        Charles Dallas: &#8216;This novel, as well as &#8216;Sainclair&#8217;, 
                        which we have already noticed, is translated, as we understand 
                        it, by Mr. Dallas, the author of Percival, &amp;c.&#8217; 
                        (Appendix to 3rd ser. 13 (Jan&#8211;Apr 1808), 525&#8211;28). 
                        Unlike 1808: 48, however, the present title-page does 
                        not attribute the translation to Dallas, and the <i>Critical 
                        Review</i>&#8217;s assertion must be regarded with some 
                        scepticism in view of this inequality.</p>

                        1975), 137&#8211;50. As Courtney describes, Walker (1779<i>&#8211;</i>1852) 
                        was a medical student in Scotland, and contributor to 
                        several medical journals, who came to London to seek literary 
                        work, and was in communication with Constant (who had 
                        also studied at Edinburgh University) during the latter&#8217;s 
                        visit to England (Jan<i>&#8211;</i>July 1816). Walker 
                        went on to have a prolific literary career of his own, 
                        writing or contributing to a variety of medical and scientific 
                        works, and acting from 1824 as the general literary editorial 
                        of the hugely ambitious though short-lived <i>European 
                        Review</i>, whose aim was to publish editions simultaneously 
                        in four different languages. Walker was evidently committed 
                        to the Encyclopaedic ideal, and a strong sense that all 
                        knowledge is related underlies a succession of more popular 
                        informational works produced in the 1830s, including <i>The 
                        Nervous System</i> (1834), <i>Intermarriage</i> (1838), 
                        <i>Women psychologically considered &#8230;</i> (1839), 
                        and <i>Female Beauty</i> (1837), the last nominally at 
                        least by Mrs Alexander Walker. Library catalogues, however, 
                        have sometimes failed to link the translator of Constant 
                        with the &#8216;physiologist&#8217; Alexander Walker, 
                        and indeed there has been a more endemic failure to bring 
                        the whole oeuvre under one single identified author. A 
                        copy of Walker&#8217;s somewhat eccentric pamphlet <i>The 
                        Political and Military State of Europe, 1807; an Address

                        &amp; Co., 1807) reportedly contains a list of other works 
                        by Walker in preparation, including novels, though without

                        Whereas the EN2 1816: 22 entry merely states &#8216;Paris, 
                        1816&#8217; for the French original, in actuality there 
                        were clearly two separate editions in French, one published 
                        from London and one from Paris, the London edition slightly 
                        ahead of the other. The first of these (Courtney 18a) 
                        bears the imprint of Henry Colburn (London) and Tr&ouml;ttel 
                        [<i>sic</i>] and Wurtz (Paris); this was entered at Stationers&#8217; 
                        Hall on 7 June 1816, having been delivered on 30 Apr to 
                        the London printers Schulze and Dean. The first Paris 
                        edition (Courtney 18b), published by Treuttel and W&uuml;rtz 
                        in association with Colburn, and presumably set from proofs 
                        sent from London, appears to have been published on or 
                        about 15 June 1816. A second edition (Courtney 18c), effectively 
                        a reissue of the first Colburn French edition, with new 
                        preliminaries and the addition of a &#8216;Pr&eacute;face 
                        de la seconde &eacute;dition&#8217;, was probably first 
                        issued in July or Aug [additional source: first advertisement 
                        in <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, 17 Aug 1816]. Walker&#8217;s 
                        translation (Courtney 18i), another Colburn production, 
                        incorporates the same Preface, and a copy was apparently 
                        entered at Stationers&#8217; Hall on 3 September 1816.

                        title to George Robert Gleig. No substantiation, however, 
                        has been discovered for such an attribution, and the present 
                        Hollis electronic catalogue for the Harvard libraries 
                        makes the more conventional attribution to Gillies. Nevertheless

                        </i>(1829: 33), seem to sit awkwardly with other contemporary 
                        works by Gillies. In his <i>Memoirs of a Literary Veteran</i> 
                        (3 vols., 1851), Gillies&#8217;s narrative covering the 
                        years 1825<i>&#8211;</i>30 highlights only one novel: 
                        &#8216;Returning to town at Christmas 1829 [&#8230;] the 
                        first use I made of my little gasp of time was to finish 
                        a book, &#8220;Basil Barrington&#8221; for which Mr. Colburn 
                        paid me &pound;200 before it was written&#8217; (<font size="-1">III</font>,

                        50) mentions no other works &#8216;by the author&#8217; 
                        on its title-page, which seems an odd omission since Colburn 
                        was also the publisher of both series of <i>Tales of a 
                        Voyager to the Arctic Ocean</i>. Two other works published 
                        in the early 1830s, <i>Ranulph de Rohais</i> (EN3 1830: 
                        51) and <i>Thurlston Tales</i> (1835: 46), published by 
                        William Kidd and John Macrone respectively, do however 
                        describes themselves as &#8216;by the Author of &#8220;Tales

                        latter are likewise conventionally attributed to Gillies, 
                        though whether by title association or for more substantive 
                        reasons is a moot point. Certainly, viewed as whole, the 
                        two series of <i>Tales of a Voyager</i> together with 
                        <i>Ranulph de Rohais</i> and <i>Thurlston Tales</i> appear 
                        to form a distinct group, with <i>Basil Barrington</i>

                        is given prominence in Gillies&#8217;s first letter to 
                        the society on 20 June 1831 (RLF 22: 708, Item 1), and 
                        was subsequently listed in appeals made in 1838, 1846, 
                        1850, and 1859 (Items 5, 8, 19, and 28). At no point on 
                        the other hand is there any mention of the two series 
                        of <i>Tales of a Voyager to the Arctic Ocean</i>, <i>Ranulph 
                        de Rohais</i>, or <i>Thurlston Tales</i>. Certainly in 
                        his appeal of 1850, Gillies introduced the possibility 
                        that not all his writings were included: &#8216;I regret 
                        to say that some of these are the only part of my published

                        to the society&#8217; (Item 19). But it is unlikely all 
                        four novels would be suppressed or difficult to find; 
                        and, unless other supportive evidence can be found, Gillies&#8217;s 
                        authorship of 1826: 38, 1829: 33, as well as EN3 1830: 
                        51 and 1835: 46, must be considered as at least doubtful<b>.</b></p>

                        FROM THE FRENCH OF MADAME DE COTTIN. The Bibliography 
                        entry is based on the Minerva Press edition, located at 
                        Yale University, at that point considered to represent 
                        the first published translation. Advertisements in the 
                        <i>Morning Chronicle</i> on 23 Jan 1807 and the <i>Star</i> 
                        on 18 Feb 1807 point to a possibly earlier 1-vol. edn 
                        issued by Oddy and Co., W. Oddy, and Appleyards. These 
                        adverts are apparently matched by the entry in OCLC (Accession 
                        No. 12265756), itself based on the copy at Indiana University 
                        (PQ2211.C53.E613.1807). The Indiana catalogue describes 
                        this as: <i>Elizabeth, or, The Exiles of Siberia: A Tale 
                        founded upon Facts from the French of Mad. Cottin</i>, 
                        London: Printed for Appleyard [and 2 others], 1807, 254p. 
                        The Glasgow University Library catalogue also describes 
                        a similarly-titled work (Sp. Coll. Z6-l.22), published 
                        by Appleyard, 1807.</p>

                        Carolina (PR.4826.J6.32.L3), describes a copy of this 
                        novel with the joint imprint: London: Printed at the Minerva 
                        Press for A. K. Newman: Edinburgh: John Anderson&#8217;. 
                        John Anderson&#8217;s name is missing in the Corvey copy 
                        used for the Bibliography entry, whose t.p. and colophons 
                        match that of a routine Minerva Press title. It is not 
                        impossible, though, that the work was actually initiated 
                        in Edinburgh, and then sold on to Newman and Co.</p>
