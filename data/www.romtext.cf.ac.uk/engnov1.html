                        English Novel, 1770-1829: A Bibliographical Survey Published 
                        in the British Isles</i>, edd. Peter Garside, James Raven, 
                        and Rainer Schöwerling, 2 vols. (Oxford: OUP, 2000). In 
                        particular, it offers fresh commentary on the entries 
                        in the second volume, which was co-edited by Peter Garside 
                        and Rainer Schöwerling, with the assistance of Christopher 
                        Skelton-Foord and Karin Wünsche, and involved close co-operation 
                        between Cardiff University and Paderborn University in 
                        Germany. While it was the aim of the Bibliography to provide 
                        a marked improvement on existing sources, any claim to 
                        have achieved absolute closure in such an unstable literary 
                        area as the novel at this period would be vain; and almost 
                        inevitably new materials have come to light in the year 
                        or so that has intervened between publication and the 
                        preparation of this report. A good proportion of these 
                        materials have emerged as a result of work at CEIR in 
                        advancing our <i>Database of British Fiction, 1800-29</i>, 
                        especially through the continuing trawls made through 
                        contemporary reviews and circulating library catalogues. 
                        Where promptings have been found in such secondary sources, 
                        they have been followed up through examination of copies 
                        of original works. New findings have also sent in by interested 
                        individuals outside Cardiff, and these communications 
                        are recognised below, while information of this nature 
                        continues to be actively sought by the CEIR team.</p>
                      <p align="justify">The entries below are organised in a 
                        way which matches the order of material within entries 
                        in the <i>English Novel, 1770-1829</i>. Sections A and 
                        B concern authorship, with the first of these proposing 
                        changes to the attribution as given in the printed Bibliography, 
                        and the second recording the discovery of new information 
                        of interest that has nevertheless not led to new attributions. 
                        Sections C and D relate to titles, the first describing 
                        ten titles which match the criteria for inclusion and 
                        should ideally have been incorporated in the printed Bibliography, 
                        while the second (D) lists a further five titles already 
                        in the Bibliography but for which surviving copies could 
                        not previously be located. The last two sections involve 
                        information such as is usually found in the <i>Notes</i> 
                        field of entries, and those owning copies of the printed 
                        Bibliography might wish (as in the case of the earlier 
                        categories) to amend entries accordingly. An element of 
                        colour coding has been used to facilitate recognition 
                        of the nature of changes, with <font color="#990033">red</font> 
                        denoting revisions and additions to existing entries in 
                        the Bibliography, and the ten new titles discovered being 
                        picked out in <font color="#005572">blue</font>. References 
                        numbers (e.g. 1800: 4) are the same as those in the <i>English 
                        Novel, 1770-1829</i>; when found as cross references these 
                        refer back to the original Bibliography, unless accompanied 
                        with 'above' or 'below', in which case a cross reference 
                        within the present report is intended. Abbreviations match 
                        those listed at the beginning volume 2 of the <i>English 
                        Novel,</i> though in a few cases these are spelled out 
                        more fully for the convenience of present readers. The 
                        entries also refer to a number of circulating library 
                        catalogues, four of which (Bettisson, Kinnear, Manchester, 
                        and Newman) are described in CEIR Project Report 4. Additionally, 
                        the present Report makes use of two further catalogues, 
                        details from which have since been added to the Database 
                        at CEIR: C. H. Marshall at Bath (1808, with MS additions), 
                        and Gerrard Tyrrell at Dublin (1834).</p>
                      <p align="justify">This report was prepared by Professor 
                        Peter Garside, with significant inputs of information 
                        from Dr Jacqueline Belanger, who collected materials in 
                        reviews and library catalogues, and Anthony Mandal, who 
                        tracked down and recorded a number of new titles. Information 
                        was also generously communicated from outside by a number 
                        of individuals, notably: Mr Roger Bettridge, of the Buckinghamshire 
                        County Record office; Dr Gillian Hughes, General Editor 
                        of the Stirling / South Carolina Research Edition of the 
                        Collected Works of James Hogg; Dr Sharon Ragaz, University 
                        of Toronto; and Professors Rolf Loeber and Magda Stouthamer-Loeber, 
                        from Pittsburgh University, whose pioneering work in preparing 
                        a Bibliography of Irish fiction has also more generally 
                        stimulated the research at Cardiff. As usual the team 
                        has greatly benefited from its association with Projekt 
                        Corvey at Paderborn University, particularly in this instance 
                        through advice about German works received from Verena 
                        Ebbes. Thanks are also due to Michael Bott, of Reading 
                        University Library, for help received in locating materials 
                        in the Longman archives; and to the trustees of the National

                        77) lists 'Child of Hope by Mrs Pilkington, 3 vols.,  
                        10s 6d'. This could refer either to Mary Pilkington (1766-1839), 
                        then mainly writing children's stories, or the shadowy 
                        Miss Pilkington, who apparently operated as a Minerva 
                        authoress between 1790 and 1802. Publication of the present 
                        work, an epistolary novel, by Vernor and Hood would seem 
                        to argue in favour of the former. See <i>English Novel</i>, 
                        vol. 1, items 1797: 66, 1798: 56, 57; 1799: 73, 74, for 
                        an uninterrupted succession of juvenile works acknowledged 
                        by Mrs [Mary] Pilkington and with the imprint of Vernor 
                        and Hood. The same publishers are also found in the case 
                        of Pilkington's<i> The Asiatic Princess </i>(2 vols., 
                        1800), omitted from vol. 2 according to the tighter rules 
                        for inclusion operating there for specialist fiction aimed 
                        at children. This title is not listed in the titles of 
                        subsequent adult works of fiction by Mary Pilkington, 
                        however, and any attribution to her must be tentative.</font></p>

                        states on its title-page 'by Harriet Ventum, author of 
                        Selina &amp;c. &amp;c.'. It is possibly a misreading of 
                        this which has led to the wrong attribution of <i>Selima, 
                        or the Village Tale</i> to Ventum: see ESTC and <i>English 
                        Novel</i>, vol. 1, 1794: 40, for the correct attribution 
                        to Margaret Holford, the elder. Excluding the falsely 
                        attributed <i>Selima</i>, apart from this work the earliest 
                        recorded publications of Ventum are <i>Justina</i> and

                        <i>English Novel</i>, vol. 1, 1798: 44), which is generally 
                        attributed to Charles Lucas, and is likewise a Minerva 
                        imprint. Lucas's first fully acknowledged fiction, <i>The

                        describes him on its title-page as 'Author of the Castle

                        <font color="#990033">A fairly confident attribution is 
                        nevertheless found in <i>The Flowers of Literature for 
                        1803</i>, a critical journal published by B. Crosby &amp; 
                        Co. According to its Introduction: 'The author of the 
                        <i>Strolling Player</i>, we understand Mr. LUCAS, a young 
                        writer of good talents and virtuous intentions, has painted 
                        human nature, in most instances, admirably correct; but 
                        sometimes injudiciously, in those situations and scenes 
                        in which she ought to be screened from the public eye. 
                        From such a writer, however, we have, in his future productions, 
                        every thing to expect; and we consider the above-mentioned 
                        novel as the first emanation of extraordinary talents' 
                        (p. xlviii). Noticeably in the short Notice (p. 461) in 
                        the main part of the journal, the publisher is given as 
                        Crosby himself, though no copy with such an imprint has 
                        been discovered. The same attribution to 'Mr Lucas' is 
                        also found in an advert by Crosby in the <i>Dorchester 
                        and Sherborne Journal</i> on 26 Aug 1803. However, Crosby's 
                        list of 'Novels' (2 pp. unn.) at end of vol. 1 of the 
                        Corvey copy of <i>Frederick Montravers</i> (1803: 77) 
                        lists 'Strolling Player, by Mr White, 3 vols., 10s 6d'. 
                        Even if Mr Lucas is accepted as the more confident attribution, 
                        there must be considerable uncertainty about his identity. 
                        Charles Lucas, while a not unlikely author for a masculinist 
                        picaresque novel such as this, had already published under 
                        his own name<i> </i>with <i>The Infernal Quixote</i> (1801: 
                        45); while little is known about William Lucas, author 
                        of the didactic <i>The Duellists</i> (1805: 51).</font><font color="4"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>

                        almost certainly the author of these tales, which may 
                        well have been published earlier singly. In a letter of 
                        6 May 1829, from the Fleet Prison, he describes himself 
                        as 'son of Mr. William Earle formerly the Bookseller in 
                        Albemarle Street', and continues: 'I am the author of 
                        several novels and Legendary Tales published at a very 
                        early age and successful in their day particularly the

                        of "Welch Legendary Tales".' In another appeal, dated 
                        23 Aug 1830, he writes: 'In that same year [1799] I wrote 
                        a most successful little work which was published in numbers 
                        by John Badcock of Paternoster Row, Earle &amp; Hemet

                        Pall Mall entitled "Welch Legends".' In this, as in other 
                        more immediately verifiable instances, Earle's recall 
                        seems to be sharp and precise, and there can be little 
                        reason now to doubt his claim to authorship.</font> Collates

                        with us' (I, 98, no. 131). The same letter also asks the 
                        recipient (who might conceivably have been an agent rather 
                        than author) to enquire after 'a MS entitled "Penrose",

                        now turns out almost certainly to have been the pseudonym 
                        of Dr George Lipscomb, MD (1773-1846), author of <i>The

                        <i>Notes</i>. <font color="#990033">Two letters in the 
                        Longman Letter Books addressed to Mrs Hughes indicate 
                        strongly that she is the author. The first, dated 18 Nov 
                        1812, states that the publisher's reader 'has given so 
                        favorable a report of your MS, that we are induced to 
                        undertake the publication'. The same letter offers settlement 
                        on a half profits basis, adding 'If this plan be agreeable 
                        to you we will put the work to press immediately &amp; 
                        print 500 or 750 copies'. It also advises 'the omission 
                        of the Introductory Chapter', and 'that the title be "She 
                        thinks for herself" simply with the motto' (I, 97, no. 
                        377). The second, dated 26 Nov 1812, makes the concession 
                        that the author should receive twenty rather than the 
                        usual dozen copies, while supplying further details about 
                        costs, and concludes 'The work may be finished we believe 
                        before the end of the Year' (I, 97, no. 381). Notwithstanding 
                        Longmans' advice in their first letter, the novel as published 
                        opens with an 'Introductory Chapter'. In this the author 
                        describes herself as plain, bookish, an 'old maid', and 
                        alone: 'At the age of forty, having lost my remaining 
                        parent, I retired to the village of Heathdale, on the 
                        western side of Sussex, where I now reside' (pp. 3-4). 
                        The title-page, on the other hand, matches Longmans' recommendation. 
                        This Mrs Hughes is given as Mrs Harriet Hughes in the 
                        typed index to the Letter Books prepared by Michael Bott.</font>

                        in favour of Catholic Emancipation, featuring Scottish

                        argues strongly in favour of this different authorship.

                        Count Constantin François de Volney (1757-1820). In the 
                        fiction itself, the narrator, as a traveller in Syria, 
                        experiences apocalyptic visions near Palymira, and records 
                        the stories of the last couple on earth. The narrative

                        [.] BY AN OLD MAN.  Newman Catalogue of 1814 (in addition 
                        to ECB and NCBEL) attributes to George Walker, the author 
                        and publisher. However, there are distinct differences 
                        between this anonymous and now rare title, in terms of 
                        its production history, and surrounding novels by Walker, 
                        which usually were acknowledged, listed other works by 
                        the author in the title, and entered into subsequent editions. 
                        It may or may not be significant that vol. 2 of the Corvey 
                        copy contains at the end a 1-page advertisement list of 
                        'Books Published and Sold by G. Walker', which begins 
                        with four novels by Walker himself, all plainly accredited 
                        there as his. The novel itself is a fairly confident direct 
                        narrative account of trials and tribulations in contemporary 
                        middle-rank society, and has a slightly ogling manner 
                        in describing its young heroines. The persona of the 'old 
                        man' ('I am too old to write for fame, and too indolent 
                        to write for profit': I, 8) is only occasionally obtrusive, 
                        and in literal terms does not match the circumstances 
                        of Walker, then in his early thirties.<font color="4"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>

                        ENTHUSIAST.  Newman Catalogue of 1814 states 'from the 
                        German of La Fontaine'. A possible clue to a German origin 
                        might lie in the Dedication 'to Her Serene Highness the 
                        Reigning Duchess of Saxe-Weimar'; but no direct evidence 
                        connecting this work with August Lafontaine has been discovered. 
                        The plot is distinct from that of <i>Lobenstein Village</i> 
                        (1804: 34), translated 'from the French [<i>sic</i>] of 
                        Augustus La Fontaine' by Mary Meeke, this presumably stemming 
                        from <i>Le Village de Lobenstein</i> (Paris 1802), which 
                        itself in its larger title wording claims to be based 
                        on the 'roman allemand [.] intitulé <i>Théodor</i>', the 
                        root German text in the <i>English Novel</i> being given 
                        as Lafontaine's <i>Theodor, oder Kultur und Huminität</i> 
                        (Berlin, 1802). The plot proper of <i>Theodore; or, The 
                        Enthusiast</i> begins at Ch. II: 'In a village in Swabia, 
                        not far from the banks of the Danube, there lived an honest 
                        and respectable family of the name of Rosenthal [.] The 
                        youngest son was Theodore'. The main parts have the all 
                        the marks of a standard bildungsroman, with Theodore having 
                        fantasies about being a soldier, visiting a Monastery, 
                        etc., and with a number of conversations involving marked 
                        speakers ('Fr Anthony' / Rosenthal / Theodore). Its denouement 
                        has Theodore revealed as brother of Theresa; and ends 
                        with him lying cold on Leonora's grave. Another Theodore 
                        is the hero of <i>Lobenstein</i> <i>Village</i>, but the 
                        story has no similarities with <i>Theodore; or, the Enthusiast</i> 
                        as described above. This Theodore is abandoned at the 
                        doorstep of the philosopher Lindner and his sister Sabina, 
                        who decide to adopt him. The village gossips do not believe 
                        the story, and rumour that Theodore is the illegitimate 
                        child of Sabina (who has recently been ill) and Lindner's 
                        friend Senk. This precipitates Senk, who loves Sabina, 
                        to propose to her to protect her virtue, and she accepts-after 
                        accepting his motives were amorous, not simply exigent. 
                        The rumours die eventually, as Lindner brings up Theodore. 
                        In the second part of the story, the adult Theodore falls 
                        in love with Eloisa, but because of the mysterious circumstances 
                        surrounding his birth, Eloisa's mother blocks their union. 
                        It transpires that his parents were aristocrats from warring 
                        sides, and that Eloisa is Theodore's cousin. Even when 
                        his grandfather accepts him, the snobbish Baroness refuses 
                        to accept the truth, until a written confession by his 
                        mother and an in-person one by his father explaining the 
                        circumstances which led them to such extreme measures 
                        makes everything satisfactory. The Baroness repents. Theodore 
                        and Eloisa marry, and enjoy the benefits of having two 
                        fathers in life. Ultimately, this novel is more of a comedy 
                        which unravels the mysteries of Theodore's birth, than 
                        a tragic bildungsroman. It is entirely possible that <i>Theodore; 
                        or, the Enthusiast</i> is German in origin, but it is 
                        distinct from <i>Lobenstein Village</i> apart from having 
                        a similarly named hero, and it would seem that this later 
                        work is probably not by August Lafontaine. It is not listed 
                        as an English translation of Lafontaine in Dirk Sangmeister,

                        'Miss Cox', dated 9 Apr 1821, is tempting in this respect:

                        were published by G. and W. B. Whittaker alone. The signature 
                        'F. J.' dated at Kensington in the Preface to <i>The Village 
                        Coquette</i> is also hard to square with authorship by 
                        Mac Nally, and noticeably in the same Preface the author 
                        refers to <i>Such is the World</i> as 'my first novel' 
                        (p. vi). In her own 'Advertisement' to <i>Eccentricity</i>,

                        of her name with 'an anonymous Publication, not of very 
                        recent date', promises 'to annex my name (as to the present) 
                        to any future Composition which I may be inclined to present 
                        to the public'. In all, there appears to be no good reason 
                        to link Mrs Mac Nally's acknowledged novel with the two 
                        later works; though on a broader front, the possibility 
                        of there being two 'Village Coquettes', or even two Mrs 
                        Macnallys, should perhaps not be overlooked. Stephen J. 
                        Brown, <i>Ireland in Fiction</i> (1919; reprinted 1970), 
                        lists <i>The Pirate's Fort</i> (1854) under Louisa M'Nally 
                        (see his Item 1069), though as if by a separate writer 
                        of the same name. OCLC WorldCat treats the authors of 
                        <i>Eccentricity</i> and <i>The Pirate's Fort</i> as the

                        the Revd William Shepherd, Rector of Margaret Roding (Essex),

                        the Longman Letter Books indicates that early in 1825 
                        the firm was dealing with Wilkins about the <i>second</i> 
                        edition of the <i>Two Rectors</i> (1824: 97) at much the 
                        same time as apparently offering terms to Shepherd for 
                        <i>The Village Pastor</i>. The full text of the key letter 
                        to the Revd Mr Shepherd on 17 Feb 1825 reads: 'We have 
                        received a letter from Dr Wilkins, in which he consents 
                        to the insertion of "by one of the authors of Body &amp;

                        after the publication £20 more' (Longman I, 101, no. 495A). 
                        Another letter, this time to the Revd Dr Wilkins, dated 
                        21 Feb 1825, indicates that Wilkins was threatening a 
                        change of publisher: 'We thank you kindly for your very 
                        friendly letter; and we certainly should feel concerned

                        to propose terms, which we hope will be satisfactory to 
                        you, for an edition of 1500 copies (the number we would 
                        advise to be printed) viz-on publication of the edition,

                        (I, 101, 494B). A postscript to this letter, adding 'We 
                        have arranged with Mr Shepherd respecting the publication 
                        of his works', also encourages the view that parallel 
                        negotiations were taking place for separate works by these 
                        two Anglican clergyman. If this interpretation is followed, 
                        then it can be seen that Wilkins himself also adopted 
                        the wording 'by one of the authors of <i>Body and Soul</i>' 
                        for the second edition of <i>The Two Rectors</i> (see 
                        1824: 97), an intention relayed in a postscript of Longmans' 
                        letter to Shepherd of 17 Feb 1825: 'Dr W. in the next 
                        edition of "The Two Rectors" intends to say "by one of 
                        the authors of B &amp; S &amp; the V. P.' While some problematical 
                        elements remain, it now seems more likely that William 
                        Shepherd, in addition to playing a part in the writing 
                        of <i>Body and Soul</i>, was the single author of <i>The

                        1819 she married James Bedingfield (a physician or surgeon-her 
                        late husband's doctor and the dedicatee of the 1815 book) 
                        and moved to Stowmarket. Her letters to Scott concern 
                        her various literary attempts; she sent him various MSS 
                        which he apparently responded to with suggestions (though 
                        none of his letters to her have been found). Scott evidently 
                        advised her to write a domestic tale, and the final letter 
                        describes how she eventually did so. She asks if she can 
                        send the MS for his perusal, and states that in writing 
                        it she 'resolved to keep in mind a few general instructions 
                        you were then so good as to suggest for that purpose'. 
                        This must have been <i>Longhollow</i>. The Preface to 
                        <i>Longhollow</i> includes mention of the Waverley novels 
                        that echoes comments she makes in a letter of 22 July 
                        1818 (NLS, MS 3889, ff. 155-57). A copy of <i>Longhollow</i> 
                        is at Abbotsford.' It is worth adding that no mention 
                        of this later work is found either in Jonathan Wordsworth's 
                        Introduction to the facsimile edition of <i>Sonnets and 
                        Metrical Tales</i> (Woodstock Books, 1996).</p>

                        of manners and of incident, which prevails throughout, 
                        is a defect in the eye of some English readers; who have 
                        not been accustomed to see the common occurrences of life 
                        written in the language of the Muses. This consideration

                        FROM THE GERMAN OF AUGUSTUS LA FONTAINE.  It is likely 
                        from the similarity of titles that this was translated 
                        from the French translation: <i>Le baron de Fleming, ou 
                        la manie des titres</i> (Paris, 1803).</p>

                        CAN WE DOUBT IT? OR, THE GENUINE HISTORY OF TWO FAMILIES 
                        OF NORWICH. BY CHARLOTTE BOURNON-MALARME, MEMBER OF THE

                        BY MRS. VILLA-REAL GOOCH. IN THREE VOLUMES. &nbsp;The 
                        French original of this novel is <i>Peut-on s'en douter? 
                        ou, histoire véritable de deux familles de Norwich</i> 
                        (Paris, 1802).</p>
                      <p align="justify"><b>1807: 3</b>  ANON, *MARGARETTA; OR 
                        THE INTRICACIES OF THE HEART.  An account for this novel 
                        (under the heading 'Margaretta') is given in Longman Commission 
                        Ledger 1C, p. 42, with an intake of 300 copies itemised 
                        on 10 August 1807. This confirms Longmans' involvement 
                        in the work, of which several American imprints survive, 
                        though a copy with a British imprint still remains elusive.</p>
                      <p align="justify"><b>1815: 54  </b>[WILLIAMS, William], 
                        THE JOURNAL OF LLEWELLLIN PENROSE, A SEAMAN.  Longmans' 
                        letter to Orton Smith dated 4 Feb 1814 (see also 1808: 
                        18, Section A, above) indicates that the firm was keen 
                        at this point to procure this work via the Revd John Eagles, 
                        the son of the author's old benefactor in Bristol, Thomas 
                        Eagles, though having previously declined it: 'Some years 
                        back we had offered to us a MS entitled "Penrose", which 
                        was in the possession of the late Mr Eagles of Bristol. 
                        We then declined it. We understand that it is now in the 
                        hands of his son, &amp; that he is disposed to part with 
                        it. If you are at all acquainted with the present Mr Eagles, 
                        we shall feel particularly obliged if you would inquire 
                        respecting it, &amp; on what terms he would part with 
                        it. [.] We should wish to see the MS before we determine 
                        finally respecting [it]' (Letter Books, I, 98, no. 131). 
                        It was presumably at much the same time as this that John 
                        Murray-the eventual publisher-was bargaining for it, with 
                        Walter Scott reportedly reading and approving the MS (the 
                        Edinburgh colophon of the printed work may be revealing 
                        in this respect). This letter, as seen here more fully, 
                        also encourages the view that Orton Smith lived in Bristol, 
                        and at least associated with clergyman, if not being actually 
                        being one himself.<font color="4"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/topbtn.gif" alt="Top of Page" width="34" height="32" border="0" align="right" class="navBlock"></a></font></p>
                      <p align="justify"><b>1816: 7</b> ANON, *MALVERN HILLS;

                        EDITION.  Additions in hand at end of Marshall's Catalogue 
                        include 'Henry Freemantle 2v 1808'. This would sees to 
                        corroborate Block's suggestion of an earlier publication 
                        under this title c.1810. 'Henry Freemantle' also appears 
                        as such in the main catalogues of Newman, Godwin and Bettison.</p>
                      <p align="justify"><b>1818: 47</b>  [PASCOE, Charlotte Champion, 
                        and WILLYAMS, Jane Louisa], COQUETRY.  The existing <i>Notes</i> 
                        field states: 'National Library of Scotland MS 322, f. 
                        285v (19 Jan 1818) shows Walter Scott recommending the 
                        work to Robert Cadell (Constable's partner), having read 
                        it in MS, and suggesting 'Trevanion' would be a better 
                        title'. Though not intended, this might give the impression 
                        that Scott was writing to Cadell. Sharon Ragaz, University 
                        of Toronto, has sent the relevant passage from what is 
                        actually Cadell's letter to Constable: 'I have called 
                        on Mr Scott [.] he spoke of a Novel written by a Lady 
                        which he thinks might do-she names it Coquetry-but he 
                        and I agreed that was nonsense-he thinks Trevanion would 
                        be better' NLS MS, f. 28<i>6</i>v). As Dr Ragaz suggests, 
                        it is likely that Scott in fact suggested 'Trevelyan' 
                        (a name in the novel itself), with Cadell mishearing. 
                        It is also apparent from the end-result that Mrs Pascoe 
                        prevailed in her original choice.</p>

                        (first full advert) in the same paper, 18 Dec 1824. These 
                        sighting, while indicating perhaps some delay in publication, 
                        would seem to contradict the statement in the existing 
                        <i>Notes</i> that the work 'almost certainly appeared 
                        early in 1825'.</p>
