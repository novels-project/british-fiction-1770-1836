'Advertisement' to the present work remarks: 'The Public are already acquainted with the Poem of Herman and Dorothea; written by the celebrated Goethe, and translated into blank verse by Mr. Holcroft. It is replete with beauties of every kind: but the extreme simplicity of manners and of incident, which prevails throughout, is a defect in the eye of some English readers; who have not been accustomed to see the common occurrences of life written in the language of the Muses. This consideration occasioned the present translation, in prose, to be undertaken' (pp. iv–v). Thomas Holcroft's verse translation was first published in 1801.

The German original title was written by August Kotzebue's daughter Amalie, who published under her married name of Ludecus. 'Preface of the Translator' (vol. 1, pp. [iii]–vii) states: 'I should have willingly made the version from the original in German; but the interdiction of the means of procuring a copy, has induced me to attempt it from a Danish translation, casually fallen into my hands' (p. v). This is followed by 'Preface of Mr. A. von Kotzebue' (pp. [viii]–xii), which of the authorship states: 'Thus much I can assure you, upon my honor [sic], that she [the author] is neither my mother, wife, or sister; but happy he that is in any degree connected with her' (p. xii).",
