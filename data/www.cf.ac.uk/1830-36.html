    <p align="justify">The Anglo–German co-operation underlying this project has 
      greatly benefited from generous support given to the two main research centres 
      at Cardiff University and the Universität-Gesamthochschule Paderborn. The 
      Cardiff team, based in the Centre for Editorial and Intertextual Research 
      (CEIR), has been supported for the duration of the project by a two-year 
      Larger Research Grant from the British Academy, which provided funds to 
      help employ Anthony Mandal as main researcher, as well as supporting travel 
      between Cardiff and Paderborn and a series of visits to major holding libraries 
      within Britain. Research at Cardiff has also benefited substantially through 
      the general support given by the School of English, Communication and Philosophy 
      at Cardiff (ENCAP) in the form of administrative support, equipment, and 
      library purchases. Among fellow members of staff and colleagues who have 
      offered help and advice are Jacqueline Belanger, Tom Dawkes, Tim Killick, 
      Sharon Ragaz, and David Skilton.</p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paderborn 
      Novel Project is especially indebted to the owner of the Fürstliche Bibliothek 
      Corvey, Franz Albrecht von Metternich-Sándor, Herzog von Ratibor und Fürst 
      von Corvey, who opened his library for international scholarship, to his 
      son Erbprinz Viktor, and the general administration at Schloß Corvey. The 
      Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, 
      generously provided financial support for the cataloguing and microfiching 
      of the Corvey Library, which in turn led to participation in the present 
      bibliography. Grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) funded 
      visits to Great Britain as well as research assistance. The Universität 
      Paderborn provided general administrative help. Thanks are also due to Günter 
      Tiggesbäumker, Hartmut Steinecke, Stephanie Junger, and Thorsten Liß for 
      help and advice.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>The 
      compilers would also like to offer special thanks to the following librarians 
      and curators for facilitating their researches and answering queries: Iain 
      Beavan (Aberdeen University Library); Michael Bott (University of Reading 
      Library); Chris Fletcher, John Goldfinch (British Library); Mr J. J. Hall 
      (University Library, Cambridge); Michael Richardson (University of Bristol 
      Library); Christopher Skelton-Foord (Bodleian Library); Daniel J. Slive 
      (University of California Library, Los Angeles). They are also grateful 
      to the British Library for permission to cite and quote from the Bentley 
      Papers; and also for permission to publish materials from the Longman archives 
      held at Reading University. Special thanks are also due to Claire Connolly, 
      Gillian Hughes, Fionnula Dillane, and Annika Bautz, who consulted material 
      in (respectively): the Houghton and Widener libraries, Harvard; Princeton 
      University Library; Trinity College, Dublin and the National Library of 
      Ireland, and Newcastle University Library. Individual assistance was also 
      provided by David Hewitt, in supporting work at Aberdeen, and Meiko O’Halloran. 
      Throughout the project close contact has also been maintained with Rolf 
      Loeber and Magda Stouthamer Loeber, whose ongoing work in compiling a Bibliography 
      of Irish Fiction has fed into the present project in a number of beneficial 
      ways.</p>

    <strong> </strong>This Bibliographical Survey, covering the years 1830–1836 
    inclusive, follows in the wake of <i>The English Novel 1770–1829: A Bibliographical 
    Survey of Prose Fiction Published in the British Isles</i>, 2 vols. (Oxford, 
    2000). Like that bibliography its entries are taken wherever possible from 
    first-hand examination of surviving copies of original first editions. The 
    period here covered links Walter Scott’s last published novel, <i>Tales of 
    My Landlord</i>, 4th series (1832), with Charles Dickens’s <i>Sketches by 
    ‘Boz’</i> (1836–7), his first work of fiction to be published as an entity. 
    Often considered to be something of a hiatus, and so far having only encouraged 
    one overview critical study, [1] the period under survey can now been seen 
    as one of variety and richness, marked rather by diversification than any 
    sustained upsurge in new titles, and exhibiting a number of transformations 
    in the production and marketing of the novel. Leading up to the accession 
    of Queen Victoria in 1837, this bibliography also offers another vital step 
    towards the building of a comprehensive record of British fiction in the nineteenth 
    century.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the inception of the project, 
    the compilers were conscious of entering into territory likely to present 
    new challenges and unexpected difficulties. As is stated in the conclusion 
    to the Historical Introduction to the second volume of <i>The English Novel 
    1770–1829</i>, the year 1829 marks a watershed in the production of fiction 
    in Britain, with a fuller realization of an extended middle-class market, 
    as evident in the success of the Magnum Opus collected edition of Scott’s 
    Waverley Novels, launched as a monthly publication from June that year. This 
    in turn provided the model for Colburn and Bentley’s Standard Novels series, 
    offering cheap one-volume editions of recently published novels, commencing 
    with James Fenimore Cooper’s <i>The Pilot</i> in February 1831 at the price 
    of 6s. (By December 1836, this series, now appearing under Bentley’s name 
    alone, had reached its 56th volume.) A considerable amount of energy during 
    the period evidently went into the production of such sets and series, ranging 
    from compilations of older works of fiction, such as the <i>Novelist’s Library</i>, 
    edited by Thomas Roscoe, planned as a classic collection, to the innovatory 
    <i>Library of Romance</i>, edited by Leitch Ritchie, whose aim was to provide 
    a regular supply a new works of fiction by leading contemporary writers, and 
    which commenced with the Banims’ <i>Ghost-Hunter and his Family</i> (see 1833: 
    9).</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another salient feature of 
    these years is the increasing practice of publishing original fiction in numbers 
    and through serialization in periodicals. The interchange between novel production 
    and magazines containing significant amounts of fiction, such as <i>Blackwood’s 
    Edinburgh Magazine </i>and the <i>Metropolitan Magazine</i>, as well as the 
    new-style annuals and keepsakes, also becomes more variegated and in bibliographical 
    terms problematic. One noticeable symptom here is the proportionately large 
    increase in the output of works of fiction consisting of a variety of individual 
    tales and sketches, a number of which openly acknowledge a source in periodicals 
    of the time. Prior serialization in magazines also led in some cases to a 
    situation where a work appeared in book form first in North America, the text 
    having been pirated from the magazine version, before the first ‘official’ 
    British edition: notable instances here are Captain Marryat’s <i>Jacob Faithful</i> 
    (see 1834:&nbsp;48) and <i>Peter Simple</i> (see 1834:&nbsp;49), and Samuel 
    Warren’s <i>Passages from the Diary of a Late Physician</i> (see 1832:&nbsp;86). 
    Other manifestations of a transformational fiction market include compilations 
    of shorter fiction, usually presented as edited by one person, such as Andrew 
    Picken’s <i>The Club-Book</i> (see 1831:&nbsp;56), which contained new writing 
    by John Galt, James Hogg, and others, and the onset of the ‘Penny Dreadful’ 
    in the last two years under view, whose small fragmented units and sensationalist 
    contents again throw out new bibliographical challenges over inclusion and 
    description.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the two volumes of <i>The 
    English Novel 1770–1829</i>, the main part of the present Checklist consists 
    of annual listings of novels as first published in Britain and Ireland during 
    the seven years covered. These annual lists are reserved for what are considered 
    in a suitably broad sense to represent works of adult prose fiction, and as 
    a whole 610 entries will be found therein, to which a further 138 titles are 
    added in the Appendices, making a sum total of 748. The criteria for inclusion 
    generally match those employed while compiling the second volume of <i>The 
    English Novel</i>, one result of this being that it is possible to make direct 
    comparisons on fronts such as the number of new titles issued annually. Works 
    published in series such as the <i>Standard Novels</i> are generally not included 
    except in cases where there is no prior record of publication. The individual 
    works published in Ritchie’s <i>Library of Romance</i>, on the other hand, 
    are given entries under the appropriate year, as representing new works of 
    fiction. In the case of three series of original titles produced by Harriet 
    Martineau during the period, however, it has been decided to supply the record 
    in the form a separate Appendix (1), partly in view of the specially programmatic 
    nature of their contents, and also to avoid the 34 titles involved unbalancing 
    the main listings. Number publications are included in the main listings granted 
    there is clear evidence of a subsequent sale in book form, and it is the completed 
    form that provides the entry, though details of constituent parts and evidence 
    of prior serialization will often be found in the notes to the entry.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In searching for potential 
    titles in the earlier stages of the project, a wide net was cast in a number 
    of directions. Initial lists were drawn up from various secondary sources, 
    these including Andrew Block’s <i>English Novel, 1740–1850</i> and Montague 
    Summers’s <i>Gothic Bibliography</i>, both used guardedly owing to their sprawling 
    and irregular nature, as well as the bibliographically reliable catalogues 
    of collections of nineteenth-century fiction assembled by Michael Sadleir 
    and Robert Lee Wolff. [2] Contemporary listings have also proved an invaluable 
    source, and trawls have been made through the lists of new publications in 
    the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> and <i>Literary Gazette</i>, and the advertisements 
    and notices in two newspapers, <i>The Star</i> and <i>The Morning Chronicle</i>. 
    Amongst modern resources, the procedure has involved isolation of all titles 
    given Dewey decimal classification as fiction in the <i>Nineteenth-Century 
    Short-Title Catalogue</i> (823 English Fiction, etc.), as well as a variety 
    of electronic searches through the OCLC FirstSearch WorldCat online database 
    (OCLC). Full searches were conducted in specialist collections of fiction 
    at Bristol and Aberdeen universities, the latter consisting to a large degree 
    of novels in their original boards. Once more, too, the unique collection 
    of novels at Schloss Corvey in Germany has served as a mainstay both in terms 
    of searching titles and recording details from original copies for the entries. 
    Throughout the bibliography, 330 of the entries assembled describe a copy 
    held in the Corvey library, the large proportion occurring in the imprint 
    years 1830–4, that is prior to the death of Victor Amadeus, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg, 
    the main collector, in 1834.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search for original editions 
    not held by Corvey (or, in a few instances, where the Corvey copy is imperfect) 
    has mainly been conducted in leading British libraries. One considerable factor 
    has been the much more extensive holdings of the British Library for this 
    period, compared with the earlier years of the nineteenth century. Some 309 
    of the entries are taken from copies in the British Library, and the project 
    is much indebted to the efficiency of service provided at St Pancras and the 
    special consideration given to our researchers. Owing to the concentration 
    of resources, and the state of copies found there, the Aberdeen holdings also 
    offered an efficient way of examining copies for some 35 entries. Novels not 
    found in the above sources have been searched and recorded in the Bodleian 
    Library, Cambridge University Library, the National Library of Ireland, the 
    National Library of Scotland, Newcastle University Library, and Trinity College, 
    Dublin. Where the British libraries failed to yield a copy the project turned 
    to North America, and the entries will show a few cases of copies recorded 
    at the libraries at Harvard, Princeton, and University of California, Los 
    Angeles. In only ten instances has it been necessary to reconstitute entries 
    from secondary sources, as a result of not being able to locate any surviving 
    copy.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One remaining special feature 
    of this Checklist, compared with its predecessors, is the extensive number 
    of titles included in Appendix 2 (104 works in all), which is reserved for 
    titles which failed, albeit often narrowly, to match the criteria used for 
    inclusion into the main annual listings. This itself reflects the proliferation 
    of sub-genres such as juvenile fiction at this period, as well as an overlapping 
    with related non-fictional modes, and beyond that no doubt the diversification 
    of the readership for fiction. A brief rationale for inclusion under one of 
    the various sub-headings of this Appendix will be found in its main header, 
    though inevitably some of the decisions made over exclusion from the main 
    listings and positioning within the sub-sections have been of a hair-line 
    nature. Unlike the final Appendix in volume 2 of <i>The English Novel</i>, 
    the present equivalent Appendix is not selective in principle but is meant 
    to display as full a record as possible of the types included. Items that 
    normally have not been given entries in either the main listings or appendices 
    include children’s fiction (pre-puberty), chapbooks and tracts, very short 
    tales, miscellanies (those consisting predominantly of essays, poetry, and/or 
    sketches), and periodical works (including annuals, gift books, and uncollected 
    serial works). Many such works have nevertheless been examined in the course 
    of the project’s searches, or in a few instances some putative titles have 
    been found to be non-existent ‘ghost’ titles or to belong to another period—these 
    ‘rejects’ amounting as a whole to 322 items (of which a list has been retained).</p>
  <p align="justify">2.          R<font size="-1">EADING THE</font> E<font size="-1">NTRIES</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><i>Arrangement<br>
    </i>In the main listings entries are listed chronologically by year of imprint. 
    Within each year, anonymous works whose authors have not been identified are 
    arranged alphabetically by title, and precede entries for novels by known 
    authors and/or translators, ordered alphabetically by author’s name, or by 
    the pseudonymous name where the author’s proper name has not been discovered. 
    In the case of compilations, the editor’s name is given, though the authorship 
    of individual constituent pieces where known is supplied in the ‘<i>Notes</i>’ 
    field of entries. Where an element of doubt remains about an attribution a 
    question mark is placed before the author name (or alternative names where 
    there is more than one claimant for authorship). Entries for authors with 
    several works in one year are ordered alphabetically by title, though evidence 
    can normally found within the entry itself about the precise chronology. In 
    those few cases where it is difficult to determine which of two editions or 
    translations of a novel were issued first, separate (a) and (b) entries are 
    supplied. Novels with volumes bearing different imprint years are not normally 
    separately entered under the respective years of publication, unless, for 
    example, a significant break took place in the publication or a new series 
    of the title is clearly indicated. On this latter basis, separate entries 
    are provided for both Mary Russell Mitford’s <i>Our Village</i>, ‘fourth series’ 
    (1830) and ‘volume V’ (1832), as for the second series of William Nugent Glascock’s 
    <i>Naval Sketch Book</i> (1834). The arrangement of the appendices follows 
    the same chronological and alphabetical procedures as the main listings, though 
    imprint years do not provide separate headings.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross-referencing within the 
    entries has mainly been used as a means of signalling: a) publication over 
    different calendar years, with markers from years other than the one where 
    the entry is placed; b) cases of contested or multiple authorship, where the 
    alternative authors are not apparent in the alphabetical ordering; c) the 
    appearance or announcement of the same novel under different titles in the 
    first year of publication. Alternative names by which a single author might 
    now be known are generally not indicated in this way, the name chosen for 
    the entries normally being that which an author published under or was known 
    by during the years under examination, though cross-references (e.g. from 
    married names, or aristocratic titles) are provided in the Author Index, which 
    also lists pseudonyms with cross-references to real author names where known.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where no surviving copy of 
    a novel in its original edition has been discovered, and its title and publication 
    details have been reconstituted from secondary evidence, the reconstituted 
    entry is marked with an asterisk * before the title and the absence of any 
    located copy is noted in the line reserved for shelf-marks and catalogues. 
    Where not already explicit, sources are given for the various elements of 
    the reconstitution.</p>
  <p align="justify"><i>Components of each entry<br>
    </i>A standard entry consists of the following eight ‘fields’:</p>
   
    <ol type="i">
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Entry number</li>
        <li>Author name(s)</li>

        <li>Place of publication and imprint details</li>
        <li>Pagination, format, and price</li>

    <p align="justify">i)        E<font size="-1">NTRY</font> N<font size="-1">UMBER</font><br>
      In the main listings, numbering starts freshly with each year. Individual 
      entries numbers consist of year followed by sequential number (e.g. <b>1835:&nbsp;57</b>), 
      and these numbers both head the entries and are also cited for cross-referencing 
      and in the indexes. Within the two appendices, the same principle applies, 
      with sub-section letter followed by sequential number (e.g. <b>A:&nbsp;17</b>, 
      <b>D:&nbsp;4</b>); a full citation in these cases also includes the appendix 
      number (e.g. <b>Appendix 2, C:&nbsp;7</b>).</p>

      N<font size="-1">AME(S)<br>
      </font></font>Each entry opens with the name(s) of the author, editor, or 
      translator, where known. Unless bracketed, names are given as they appear 
      on the title-page. Square brackets are used to denote information supplied 
      by outside information. Additions which help complete names, supplied through 
      researched information (e.g. a fuller or extra Christian name), are likewise 
      given in square brackets. In instances where information is found within 
      the text (e.g. a signature at the end of a preface), but is not displayed 
      on the title-page, this is denoted by the use of surrounding curly brackets—as, 
      for example, in <b>BRAY, {A}[nna] {E}[liza]</b>, in which case the title-page 
      attribution is to ‘Mrs. Bray’, but the Introduction is signed ‘A. E. B’. 
      ‘Mr’, Mrs’, and ‘Miss’ are omitted, unless these are the only qualification 
      to the surname or indication of gender. Where no author has been identified, 
      the entry opens with ‘ANON.’. In some cases where evidence concerning the 
      authorship is not conclusive, information about possible attributions can 
      be found in the notes field, with references to names also being given in 
      the Author index. Translators and editors are treated similarly to authors, 
      with the additions of ‘(<i>trans</i>.)’ and ‘(<i>editor</i>)’ immediately 
      after the names: author names always have sequential priority. A pseudonymous 
      name is followed by ‘[pseud.]’, with doubt as to whether the name is real 
      or not being indicated by ‘[pseud.?]’</p>
    <p align="justify">iii)      F<font size="-1">ULL</font> T<font size="-1">ITLE<br>
      </font>The title is given in full as it appears on the title-page, with 
      block capitals being used throughout, no attempt being made to replicate 
      peculiar fonts and combinations of letters found in the originals. Mottoes 
      and special headers are generally excluded, though the notes often pick 
      up on special features of interest. In the case of works appearing as a 
      part of a series, the series title-page (where extant) is also transcribed 
      in full in the notes. Where an engraved title-page is found in addition 
      to a standard (conventionally printed) title-page, the latter is transcribed 
      to make the entry, though any significant variants or additional features 
      in the engraved title are recorded in the notes. Use of ‘[<i>sic</i>]’ to 
      indicate features such as idiosyncratic spellings is sparing; and in a few 
      cases, especially where misreading is possible,  supplementary punctuation 
      is supplied is square brackets. Where variations are found between the titles 
      of the different volumes of a novel, the differences are recorded in the 
      notes section.</p>
    <p align="justify">iv)      P<font size="-1">LACE OF</font> P<font size="-1">UBLICATION 
      AND</font> I<font size="-1">MPRINT</font> D<font size="-1">ETAILS<br>
      </font>The first-named place of publication on the original imprint is given 
      first, followed (after a colon) by the full details of publishers, booksellers, 
      and printers as they appear on the title-page up to the imprint date. A 
      comma separates this information from the date, which is always given in 
      arabic numerals even when in roman on the original. Where a place of publication 
      is not named on the imprint but is inferred or researched from other information, 
      this is given in square brackets. Where no date is given on the title-page 
      the abbreviation n.d. (no date) is used, followed by an attributed date 
      in square brackets. With multi-volume works the first volume normally supplies 
      the details, and any differences found in the imprint information in other 
      volumes is recorded in the notes. In the case of different years of publication 
      between volumes of the same work, this is presented in the form of a split 
      date at the end of the line, for example ‘1834/36’. Printer details not 
      found within the imprint itself are not recorded in this field, though details 
      found elsewhere in colophons and other printer marks (say, on the verso 
      of the title-page) are systematically recorded in the notes section (see 
      below).</p>
    <p align="justify">v)          P<font size="-1">AGINATION,</font> F<font size="-1">ORMAT,

      The last roman and arabic page of each volume is given, with instances where 
      both types of pagination are continuous being recorded in the notes. These 
      page numbers are preceded, in the case of multi-volume novels, by the volume 
      number in upper-case roman. Where volumes of the same work bear different 
      imprint dates this is indicated in parenthesis after the volume numbers. 
      Illustrations are abbreviated as ‘ill.’, and are signalled after the page 
      number, separated by a comma: normally this is reserved for cases where 
      pictorial images are involved, vignettes consisting only of a design not 
      normally being counted as illustrations. Where pagination information is 
      unavailable because no copy has survived, the number of volumes only is 
      indicated.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format of each copy examined 
      has been individually checked by collation of leaves. Whereas in the period 
      1770–1829 the majority of novels were published either in octavo (8vo) or 
      duodecimo (12mo) formats, with gatherings respectively of eight or twelve 
      leaves, the increasing use of the smaller 18mo and 16mo formats in the period 
      under view has led to fresh complications. Copies in 18mo examined often 
      collate in sixes, but sometimes in twelves and sixes, whereas 16mo generally 
      collates in eights. A main indication in these cases then is that page sizes 
      are smaller than would be expected for 8vos or for 12mos in half-sheets. 
      Due consideration has been taken of this factor in making decisions, though 
      because of the variations found between copies of the same work, owing to 
      cropping and other factors, no record of page diameters has been given in 
      the entries. Secondary sources such as contemporary listings sometimes give 
      useful information about format, but because of its variable quality this 
      has at best been used guardedly.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price is given in shillings 
      (s) and pence (d) as found in the work itself or in newspapers and other 
      listings, with the accompanying description where found (most commonly ‘in 
      boards’). Sources for the information are also given, in parenthesis, these 
      including spine label (s.l.), MC, LG, ER, and ECB. All variants are provided.</p>

      Unlike in the preceding printed volumes of <i>The English Novel</i>, no 
      attempt is made to record surviving reviews, a task made all the more difficult 
      by the increasing diversification of reviewing outlets and methods during 
      this period. As an alternative, this field in its present form records details 
      from a variety of contemporary listings, which offer invaluable information 
      on matters such as impression numbers, price, and (most pertinent here) 
      dates of first publication. Four categories of record are provided, in the 
      following order: publishing records (the Bentley Papers and Longman Archives); 
      newspaper notices (<i>The Star</i> and <i>Morning Chronicle</i>); listings 
      of new works from periodicals (the <i>Literary Gazette</i> and <i>Edinburgh 
      Review</i>); and, finally, <i>The English Catalogue of Books, 1800–1836</i> 
      (ECB). A typical entry then might look like: <b>BP (1 Jan 1832); Star (2 
      Jan 1832); LG 780: 842 (31 Dec 1831); ER 54: 560 (Dec 1831); ECB 84 (Dec 
      1831)</b>. In the case of entries from newspapers, <i>The Star</i> is used 
      as the main source until its demise in 1835, the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> 
      serving as its replacement for 1836 and as a source in 1835 when information 
      from <i>The Star</i> is absent or less accurate. The entry given from newspapers 
      is the first considered to give an indication of the publication date of 
      the work, though other information gleaned from this source (such as advance 
      notices) is provided in the notes section. In the case of periodicals, the 
      information is taken from the list of ‘New Books/ Publications’ found near 
      the end of the weekly issues of the <i>Literary Gazette</i> and the quarterly 
      numbers of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. For pinpointing dates of publication, 
      then, one might expect a diminishing chance of precision as the entries 
      proceed, with the exception of ECB which in these last years that it records 
      is more focused than previously.</p>

      This field always begins with an abbreviation for the library holding the 
      copy of the novel examined (or statement of inability to locate a copy), 
      followed by the holding library’s press-mark. In the case of novels held 
      by the Corvey library, where no current catalogue numbers exist, the ISBN 
      of the Corvey Microfiche Edition (CME) is given as the most useful identifying 
      call number. In a handful of instances, where the Corvey copy is incomplete 
      or otherwise imperfect (e.g. lacks a subscription list), alternative copies 
      have been sought to provide the entry, the presence of a copy in Corvey 
      in these cases being signalled by the inclusion of the CME ISBN number after 
      the shelf-mark of the actual contributing library. (In a few cases, where 
      no CME exists for the Corvey copy used, the library alone is signalled, 
      though if a CME number for same title in a subsequent edition is available 
      the reference number is supplied under ‘Further Editions’ at the end of 
      the entry.)</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details are then given from 
      two leading modern database catalogues of printed books and holding libraries: 
      the <i>Nineteenth-Century Short-Title Catalogue </i>(NSTC) and OCLC FirstSearch 
      WorldCat Catalogue (OCLC). In both instances, a reference number is given 
      first, followed by information about the number of holding libraries in 
      parenthesis. Where NSTC includes more than one number for the same item 
      (under both author and title, for example), the number cited is normally 
      the one based on author, or, failing that, the largest of the entries. NSTC, 
      which itself is based on library catalogues, at this phase records holdings 
      from six British and Irish libraries and two major North American libraries:</p>
   
    <blockquote> British Library; University Library, Cambridge; Trinity College, 
      Dublin; National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh; University of Newcastle 
      Library; Bodleian Library, Oxford; Library of Congress, Washington; Harvard 
      University.</blockquote>
   
    <p align="justify">The library holdings given in parenthesis relate to these 
      institutions only, and are ordered alphabetically by abbreviation, with 
      British and Irish (BI) libraries first, followed by North American (NA) 
      ones. In each entry, the holding libraries given are amalgamated from all 
      NSTC entries for the work.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OCLC entries differ slightly 
      by giving the accession number for the record chosen followed by the number 
      of holding libraries in parenthesis: e.g.<b> OCLC 42447732 (42 libs</b>). 
      In a number of cases, more than one OCLC record is available for what is 
      in all probability the same original edition, and in these cases the policy 
      has been to choose the more substantial record, granted its details unequivocally 
      match the edition being described for the entry. Because of the complexity 
      of the situation sometimes found, no attempt has been made to amalgamate 
      the numbers of holding libraries given in different records. Where the OCLC 
      record used applies only to microform copies of the work, this is recorded. 
      Unlike NSTC, OCLC is a database which is being constantly updated and enlarged, 
      and the details supplied apply to the period 2002–3 when the present entries 
      were being assembled. </p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one of the libraries 
      specified in NSTC provides the actual copy consulted for the entry (and 
      is thus given with shelf-mark at the beginning of the entry), that library 
      is omitted from the holding libraries abbreviated later in parenthesis.

      The notes section is not used to record information comprehensively, but 
      is intended primarily to supply readers with additional information of interest, 
      including for example details of dedications, subscription lists, and advertisements 
      within the novels. In the case of translations from another language, basic 
      details are provided of the original source text and date and place of publication. 
      Additional information about authorship is also placed near the beginning 
      of this section, with reasons for new attributions and explanations of difficulties 
      encountered in ascription. Details concerning the actual copy of the work 
      examined generally follow the arrangement of its contents, while further 
      notes are given in much the same order as other parts of the full entry. 
      Information concerning impression numbers, as found in publishing archives, 
      for example, are generally found near the end of the main notes section.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two particular areas the 
      notes make an advance compared with the previous printed Bibliography, covering 
      1770–1829. In view of the relatively high proportion of works of fiction 
      incorporating a variety of separate tales, an effort has been made to record 
      in some detail the titles of the constituent items and the inclusive page 
      numbers in which they are contained. In giving the pagination of tales within 
      works, the beginning of the tale is counted from the individual subordinate 
      title-page (where this appears); and normally the wording of a tale’s title 
      is given from the header of the tale itself, rather than the contents list. 
      The other advance is that a systematic effort has been made in the notes 
      to record printer information as found in colophons and other printer’s 
      marks outside the main imprint. In the case of London printers, a degree 
      of standardization has taken place, with the suppression of recurrent details 
      such as ‘London’ and ‘Printed by’ from the description given, some ironing 
      out of accidentals such as hyphens and initial capitals, and (where there 
      are variations in detail within a work) utilization generally of the fullest 
      form found. In the case of non-London printers, where a place other than 
      London is given this is included in the description: e.g. <b>Printer’s mark 
      reads: ‘Dumfries: Printed by John M‘Diarmid and Co.’, with similar colophon</b>. 
      Where colophons and printer’s marks of different printers are found between 
      the different volumes of a work, indicating (say) that it was parcelled 
      out between more than one firm, this is also recorded in detail. Where no 
      printer information is found (other than in the main imprint), this is usually 
      noted.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also listed are further editions 
      of the novel published up to 1870. In identifying these, NSTC and OCLC have 
      both played a major part, though additional information has also been supplied 
      by reliable sources such as the published records of the collections of 
      Michael Sadleir and Robert Lee Wolff, and occasionally through hands-on 
      work in existing library collections. Up to five further editions published 
      in Britain and Ireland are listed, with supporting references in appendices 
      (in those cases where xOCLC or xNSTC has been recorded in the main entry, 
      a full reference number is also given for the first British or Irish edition 
      to found in those resources). Places of publication for further editions 
      are recorded where they differ from that of the main entry. Where more than 
      five editions have been identified, the number of additional editions reliably 
      identified is given in square brackets (e.g. as <b>[at least 5 more edns. 
      to 1870]</b>). The sequence of British and Irish editions is then followed 
      by citation of the first known North American edition before 1870, except 
      in cases where the American edition preceded the British (in which case 
      the latter provides the entry, and information about its American predecessor 
      is provided in the main notes section). In cases where different editions 
      appear to have been published in the first known year of publication in 
      North America (e.g. in both New York and Philadelphia), the first of these 
      alphabetically by place of publication is given, followed by the other(s).</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details are also supplied 
      of the first known translations into foreign languages up to 1870, with 
      a record of titles where these differ substantively and/or interestingly 
      from the English original.</p>

    in the present form […] The author is aware that many Tales and Novels of 
    this cast have appeared with much greater pretensions than the present series; 
    but one fault, with only two or three exceptions, belongs to them all, namely, 
    an absence of that quaint and once familiar expression, without which the 
    dialogues in tales of this description convey but a faint idea of the manner 
    of speech of our ancestors. // The illustrative engravings present an attraction 
    in addition to their excellence as works of art—that of having been executed 
    with a due regard to historical propriety, the costume of each character being

    Constable.) // The Authors of the pamphlet state that, believing in the good 
    accruing from satirical personality, they have paid special attention to the 
    remarkable novel […] called “The Exclusives,” in order to extend the sphere 
    of its usefulness by making the personality more apparent, and by supplying 
    the real name of the characters who figure in its pages. It is further added 
    that one of the objects of the story is “to delineate the real features of 
    that mysterious society, so long known to exist in the very heart of the high 
    classes, under the denomination of the ‘Exclusives.’&nbsp;” // At the back 
    of the title is printed a Key to the Characters of the Story, the real names 
    being indicated by some of the letters only. In the copy of the pamphlet, 
    in the British Museum [now in the British Library] the majority of these skeleton

    <i>Notes.</i> Persian original not discovered. Preface, pp.&nbsp;[v]–xi, subscribed 
    ‘2, South Crescent, Bedford Square’. This notes: ‘The eminent personage who 
    figures as the hero was in his time a pattern of wisdom, bravery, and generosity. 
    He has been therefore chosen as a proper theme by the writer of romance, who 
    spurning the bounds of reality, has created an ideal world of his own, with 
    that wildness and extravagance of fancy which characterise an eastern imagination’ 
    (pp.&nbsp;[v]–vi). It also states: ‘This circumstance has induced me, under 
    the auspices of the High and Illustrious Personages who contribute to the 
    Oriental Translation Fund, to offer to the public the following English version, 
    as a specimen of the romance of a nation that has long ranked as the most 
    refined in Asia’ (p.&nbsp;vi), adding that ‘The manuscript from which the 
    present translation is made, was procured in the East in 1824. It gives no 
    notice as to the place and time of writing’ (p.&nbsp;vii). The text is richly 
    annotated with references to the original language, customs, etc. of the East.

    recently superintended a Colonial experiment of great magnitude, it may be 
    imagined that in Judiville he has described his own undertaking. This is not 
    the case; for the narrative embraces the substance of his knowledge, whether 
    obtained by inquiry, observation, or experience. The subject is more important 
    than novels commonly treat of.—A description, which may be considered authentic, 
    of the rise and progress of a successful American settlement, cannot but be 
    useful to the emigrant who is driven to seek a home in the unknown wilderness 
    of the woods. […] The book, therefore, though written to amuse, was not altogether

    <i>Notes.</i> NSTC states that ‘Martin Doyle’ was Hickey’s pseudonym. Preface 
    (3 pp.&nbsp;unn.), dated ‘Ballyarley, June 1st 1830’, notes that ‘some striking 
    coincidences’ between the present work and the recently published <i>Traits 
    and Stories of the Irish Peasantry</i> by William Carleton (1830: 37) are 
    purely accidental, the author having not seen the prior work until after completing 
    his own, as his ‘very respectable’ publishers can vouch for. The object of 
    the author ‘has been to convey sound practical advice to the rural population 
    of his country […] free from the vulgar caricature, as well as the coarseness 
    and blasphemies, with which too many Irish tales of the present day, so copiously 
    and offensively abound […] In the occasional introduction of Anglo–Hibernian 
    diction, phraseology, and pronunciation, he trusts he has not deviated from 
    the faithful delineation of Irish character, in the South Eastern parts of 
    the Province of Leinster.’ Adv. as ‘Lately Published’ (verso facing t.p.) 
    for the same author’s ‘Hints originally intended for the small farmers of 
    the County of Wexford, but suited to most parts of Ireland […] a new edition, 
    with Hints on the Cultivation of Tobacco.’ Printer’s mark of John S. Folds,

    as people do not, now-a-days, write down to those little folks, and as the 
    Author has herself, in common with her wisers and betters, a strong propensity

    of Juljan Ursin, the author’s native names. Trans of the German trans. <i>Levi 
    und Sara. Briefe polnischer Juden; ein Sittengemälde</i> (Berlin, 1825) of 
    the Polish original <i>Leybe i Siora czyli listy dwoch kochankow</i>, 2 vols. 
    (Warsaw, 1821). Preface, pp.&nbsp;[v]–xix, gives details about the author’s 
    biography and career and notes: ‘Several of his [Niemcewicz’s] works have 
    been translated into German, but, as far as is known to the Editor, not into 
    any other European language’ (p.&nbsp;xi). It adds: ‘As he [Niemcewicz] knew 
    the Editor did not understand the Polish language, he presented him with a 
    German translation of it, executed under his own inspection, from which the 
    English edition now presented to the public has been translated’ (pp.&nbsp;[xvi]–xvii). 
    In the preface the editor also describes his impressions of Jewish life received 
    during a journey through Poland, and outlines Niemcewicz’s intention: ‘That 
    gentleman [Niemcewicz] lamented the condition of so large a part of the population, 
    and regretted, that for their own sakes, so little progress has attended the 
    attempts that had been directed towards leading them to the knowledge and 
    acceptance of the Christian faith. He said, that attempts had been made, as 
    it was found impracticable to convert them into good Christinas, to convert 
    them into good subjects, without interfering with their religious prejudices. 
    As he thought a moral and industrious Jew better than a knavish and idle one, 
    he had written a Tale, with the hope of benefiting them’ (p.&nbsp;xvi). Adv.

    Brought before the Tribunal at the Grand Inquisition’. Final page contains 
    an untitled address by the author, which states: ‘The authoress of the foregoing 
    pages, having arrived at the conclusion of her work, entreats the indulgence 
    of the reader for the numerous errors which, doubtless, may be observed; though 
    she trusts her work is free from those glaring defects which lead aside the 
    understanding, and which enervate and corrupt the heart. The first attempt 
    of an author must be feeble. Difficulties without number interrupt his progress. 
    One, not the least among them, is the fear of having his efforts crushed once 
    more by the voice of the critic. If but a trifling degree of merit is allowed 
    by the generous heart, who can regard the feelings of an author, these pages 
    will not have been written in vain; for who will then experience a portion 
    of that pleasure which will reward her for all cares.’ Printer’s colophon

      <i>Notes.</i> Note in vol. 1, verso of t.p., states: ‘In consequence of 
      certain peerages, since this work was written, an awkward coincidence of 
      names occurs, in one or two instances, which it is hardly necessary to say 
      is entirely accidental.’ Preface, pp.&nbsp;v–viii, addressed to the ‘Kind 
      Reader’, opens: ‘There is one great truth which many parts of this book 
      were intended to illustrate—viz. the monopoly of political power is a curse, 
      and not a blessing, to those by whom it is retained’. It also includes quotation 
      from <i>Westminster Review</i> (Jan 1824), and closes with mention of work 
      in educating people of Henry Brougham. Adv. lists (vol. 1, 4 pp.&nbsp;unn.;

      I translated from the Tamul the following tales, called the Vedàla Cadai 
      (Vetàla Cat’hà, Sans.) partly for amusement and partly for the sake of keeping 
      up a knowledge of the language in which they were written. I subsequently 
      presented my version to the Royal Asiatic Society, under a belief that it 
      might prove useful to any one engaged in the study of the Tamul language, 
      and it has lately attracted the attention of the Oriental Translation Committee, 
      who have been pleased to give directions for its publication’ (p.&nbsp;3).

      ‘In the multitude of competitors at present pressing on through the literary

      ‘In consequence of Miss Jewsbury’s and other contributors arriving too late

      be in the recollection of many of the readers of “The Gentleman in Black,” 
      that a <i>portion</i> of the work appeared some years ago, in a periodical 
      entitled “The Literary Magnet.” That publication, however, having long since 
      been discontinued, the greater part of this volume has never yet appeared 
      in print. At the request of the Subscribers, who were anxious that the tale 
      should be completed, it was the author’s intention to have had it <i>immediately</i> 
      re-published in an entire form, but on applying for the remainder of the 
      manuscript, he was informed that it was <i>mislaid</i>. He has, therefore, 
      been under the necessity of entirely re-writing it, and now,—having received 
      his latest corrections—aided by the powerful talent of Mr. George Cruikshank,—it 
      is presented to the public. // <i>Old Bond Street</i>, <i>Nov</i>. 25, 1830.’

      to my great dismay, that a remarkable coincidence in many trifling points 
      existed between the two works’ (p.&nbsp;ix). The author also quotes from 
      her letter to the editor of the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, dated ‘March 2, 
      1814’, and published in ‘Vol. II for the year 1814, page 423’, describing 
      similarities to Edgeworth’s novel (pp.&nbsp;x–xii). Furthermore, the author 
      states that she desisted from publication in order to avoid being accused

      <i>Notes.</i> Preface (2 pp.&nbsp;unn.), in vol. 1, undercutting the concept 
      of prefaces in general. This is followed by ‘Note’ (2 pp.&nbsp;unn.) apologizing 
      for inconsistencies in proper names, and (ostensibly) acknowledging the 
      help of the house readers and printers: ‘The long sentences made short, 
      the obscure made plain, the favourite words that would, like “Monsieur Tonson, 
      come again,” the duplicate quotations,—for the amendment of all these, I 
      beg to make at once my acknowledgments and my thanks.’ This last also notes 
      that one of the characters has been called by various names in different 
      parts of the novel, owing to the author’s difficulty in settling on a final 
      name: ‘Only a modern author can know the plague of names. I have read the 
      Peerage through twice, and actually became interested in the divisions of 
      the House, to see if there was “a pretty name” in either majority or minority.’

      enough to fit their heads with a fool’s-cap. If, therefore, conscience-stricken, 
      some individuals (a thing I doubt not) should perceive a <i>stray</i> likeness

      even self can see.’ Narrative proper ends on vol. 3, p.&nbsp;274, and is 
      followed by ‘Notes on Naval Reform’, pp.&nbsp;[275]–298. List (2 pp.&nbsp;unn.) 
      of ‘New Works of Fiction by Distinguished Writers, just Published by Henry

      reads: ‘London: Ibotson and Palmer, Printers, Savoy Street, Strand’. BP 
      notes: ‘For some special reason the anonymity of this work was preserved 
      for a great number of years with exceptional strictness, and indeed the 
      author’s name does not appear on the contract for publication, or even that 
      of his proxy in full. Owing to this circumstance when nearly half a century 
      later Lord Houghton made some enquiries in New Burlington Street as to the 
      authorship of “Cavendish” without success, he went away under the impression 
      that, owing no doubt to the responsible position of the unrevealed, or possibly 
      royal, author, great importance was still attached to secrecy. […] These

      <i>Notes.</i> Preface, pp.&nbsp;[v]–viii, describes the work as a development 
      from her earlier lessons to young people: ‘the authoress has attempted, 
      in numerous instances, to clothe the most serious and important lessons 
      in such various and alluring attire as she thought best calculated to captivate 
      the attention of the young and the thoughtless […] Proceeding on a more 
      extended scale, she has at length been induced to imagine such a narrative 
      as might, in its progress, give her an opportunity of shewing how a Christian 
      ought to act in the various situations of <i>brother, husband, father, servant, 
      master</i>—of exemplifying the most beautiful forms of the <i>female character</i> 
      under various and trying circumstances,—and of exhibiting a specimen of 
      that most rare, and perhaps least understood of human characters,—the exalted, 
      the disinterested, the warm and tender <i>friend</i>’ (pp.&nbsp;[v]–vi). 
      Though targeted at least partly towards young people, the work is centred 
      on an adult protagonist and is in the form of a standard novel. Lists of

          calculated, in many respects, to condemn rather than to serve the work 
          which succeeds them. “The Democrat”. and “The Hugonot”, were written

          might have appeared in a different form’ (p.&nbsp;xvii). ‘The Democrat’

          ‘recording of Irish grievances and observations on events resulting

          “Alberic” is said to be founded on an old chronicle of the year 1343,

          <i>Notes.</i> Preface, pp.&nbsp;[i]–xi, notes: ‘some portion of my work 
          has, in another form, already been published, and now appears with some 
          of the scenes of a Sailor’s Life enlarged […]. Every scene is a scene 
          of real life, not exaggerated’ (p.&nbsp;[i]). Reference is also made 
          to fellow sailor-writers: ‘The gates of knowledge throughout the whole 
          world are opened to us; but, I grieve to say, we slumber at the portals, 
          or have hardly energy to enter. Some there are, and happy am I to bear 
          witness to their talents—such are Parry, Franklin, Hall, Marryat, Glascock, 
          Beaver, Beaufort, &amp;c.—these men have exalted our profession, and 
          stamp the lie upon the assertion , “that sailors are fools”&nbsp;’ (p.&nbsp;vi). 
          The preface concludes by pre-empting claims that the work derives from 
          ‘the admirable Autobiography of Captain Basil Hall’: ‘The first number 
          of the Metropolitan Magazine, which began in May, 1831, had the first 
          chapter of this work in its pages. Captain Hall’s work did not appear 
          until two months afterwards’ (p.&nbsp;xi). The work as a whole often 
          reads like personal memoirs, though including fictional components such 
          as dialogue; it also later became part of the Standard Novels series.

          away the ruins, we perceived a flight of steps which led to a small 
          square chamber. One of the sailors more in advance, stumbled over what 
          on examination proved to be a coffer of Irish black oak, curiously carved. 
          Having brought it into the court, the Catholic clergyman belonging to 
          the island happened to come up as we were examining the contents, which 
          proved to be several rolls of parchment, closely written upon in the 
          Spanish language. // The priest here offered his services to translate

          Peninsular War, to the Duke of Wellington.’ (p.&nbsp;[iii]) A postscript 
          to the dedication reads: ‘Herewith you will receive 4 brace moorfowl, 
          2 ditto B. cocks, item 3 hares, one side of a roe, and one gallon whisky

          ‘&nbsp;“Sir Ralph Esher” was a fictitious autobiography. The opening 
          of the court scenes were suggested by the locality of Epson, to which 
          place we had removed. […] It was given to the world anonymously, and 
          notwithstanding my wishes to the contrary, as a novel; but the publisher 
          pleaded hard for the desirableness of so doing; and as he was a good-natured 
          man, and had liberally enabled me to come from Italy, I could not say 
          nay. It is not destitute of adventure, and I took a world of pains to 
          make it true to the times which it pictured; but whatever interest it 
          may possess is so entirely owing, I conceive, to a certain reflecting 
          exhibition of character, and to facsimile imitations of the courts of 
          Charles and Cromwell, that I can never present it to my mind in any 
          other light than that of a veritable set of memoirs. // The reader may 
          judge of the circumstances under which authors sometimes write, when 
          I tell him that the publisher had entered into no regular agreement 
          respecting this work; that he could decline receiving any more of it 
          whenever it might please him to do so; that I had nothing else at the 
          time to depend on for my family; that I was in very bad health, never 
          writing a page that did not put my nerves into a state of excessive 
          sensibility, starting at every sound; and that whenever I sent the copy 
          up to London for payment, which I did every Saturday, I always expected, 
          till I got a good way into the work, that he would send me word he had 
          had enough.’<br>

          notes: ‘It has been frequently remarked concerning the class of periodicals 
          of which the volume now submitted to the public is the youngest, that 
          they present too uniform a resemblance to each other, and that, while 
          increasing in number, their object and plan make no corresponding advances 
          toward originality. […] Impressed with the belief that the taste for 
          the wild and wonderful will endure as long as man retains the faculty 
          of imagination, we have selected from the varied walks of literature 
          the fairy track of Romance. On that enchanted path we purpose rambling 
          from year to year […] In this introductory effort, the wish to give 
          all the effect in our power to the graphic designs of Mr. Prout, has 
          induced us to draw upon the resources of natives of the countries that 
          supply the scenes illustrated. […] A proportion of the tales is entirely 
          original, and was furnished for the work by an accomplished foreigner.’ 
          This is followed by a list of contents (p.&nbsp;vii) and ‘List of Plates, 
          Engraved under the Superintendence of Mr. E. I. Roberts’ (p.&nbsp;ix) 
          for the 13 plates in the work. Contains: ‘The Fanatic. A Tale of the 
          Netherlands. Freely Modernised from an Old Dutch Chronicle’, pp.&nbsp;[1]–35; 
          ‘The Wax Figure’, pp.&nbsp;36–76; ‘The Cottage of Koswara. A Hungarian

          <i>Notes.</i> BP notes that this is a ‘collection of sketches of American 
          life, compiled by William [<i>sic</i>] Athearn Jones. […] From the contents 
          of the papers referring to this work, it would appear that Miss Mitford’s 
          connection with it was a nominal one’. The reference to William Athearn 
          Jones is almost certainly erroneous, and should read James Athearn Jones, 
          who was the author of various works connected to North America. Preface, 
          pp.&nbsp;[iii]–vi, signed ‘Mary Russell Mitford’ and dated ‘Three Mile 
          Cross, May, 1832’. This refers to the work as ‘another Collection of 
          Native American Sketches’ edited by Mitford (p.&nbsp;[iii]) and notes: 
          ‘the Stories came to me scattered over the Miscellaneous Collections 
          of many years, some of them in MS. transcripts from books out of print 
          or otherwise rare, and all or nearly all either wholly anonymous or 
          distinguished by signatures evidently fictitious. Even in the list of 
          Authors prefixed to my former Work, although I had taken much pains 
          to be correct, I have discovered at least two errors of omission; the 
          name of Mr. Sands […] and of Mr. Bryant, the great poet of America. 
          […]. Of the Writers in the present Selection I am still more uncertain, 
          though I believe them generally the same with the former. “The Young 
          Backwoodsman” is, I am informed, the production of the Rev. Mr. Flint; 
          “The Green Mountain Boy” bears the signature of Mr. Barker; “Modern 
          Chivalry” assuredly belongs to my friend Miss Sedgwick; and I suspect 
          Mr. Paulding’s keen and clever pen in “The Politician” and “The Azure 
          Hose”&nbsp;’ (pp.&nbsp;iv–v). Lists of contents (1 p.&nbsp;unn. each)

          ‘London, February 3, 1832’. In this, ‘the Editor’ looks for a favourable 
          reception of the work in its present republished form: ‘He was led to 
          indulge such hopes, by seeing the flattering terms in which this Diary 
          was mentioned, from time to time, by many respectable journals in London 
          and elsewhere, during its successive appearance in Blackwood’s Magazine; 
          by the circumstances of its translation into the French language at 
          Paris; and by its republication separately in America, where the sale 
          has been so extensive, that the work is now stereotyped’ (p.&nbsp;[v]). 
          This ‘Notice’ adds: ‘Much new matter , however, will be found introduced 
          in the notes, and the whole has been very carefully revised—although

                Family. London: Smith, Elder and Co., 65, Cornhill. 1833’. Preface 
                to the Series, pp.&nbsp;[iii]–xii, precedes the story of ‘The 
                Ghost-Hunter and his Family’. This states: ‘It is some years since 
                the Editor of this work conceived the idea of publishing a series 
                of original works of fiction, at little more than a fourth part 
                of the usual price. At that time the business of novel-publishing 
                touched upon its zenith’ (p.&nbsp;[v]). It continues later: ‘The 
                Editor would willingly indulge himself in tracing the causes of 
                decline and fall of this system […] were it not irrelevant to 
                his present purpose. All he has now to do is to exhibit the nature 
                of his own plan […] The price given will be regulated in the first 
                place, by merit of the work, and in the second place, by the popularity 
                of its writer; and the sum agreed upon will be paid in bank notes 
                immediately on the assignment of the copyright. // Each volume 
                will be fairly brought before the public. No expense will be spared’ 
                (pp.&nbsp;vii–viii). As a result, the editor anticipates a changed 
                fiction industry: ‘One effect of the plan will be to diminish 
                the number of novels; for it is manifest, that no work which is 
                not presumed to be calculated for extensive circulation, will 
                be published at such a price. This will be a benefit even to the 
                book-sellers themselves […] for the great majority of existing 
                novels is formed of <i>unsuccessful</i> ones’ (p.&nbsp;ix). According 
                to the same preface, the series will include: original novels 
                by well-known and unknown authors; translations of novels in foreign 
                languages; adaptations of works in foreign languages; reprints 
                and adaptations of American novels. ‘Advertisement’ (1 p.&nbsp;unn.)

                of this <i>Second</i> Series, the Author has only to observe, 
                that the volumes constituting the <i>First</i> <i>Series</i> had 
                an excellent sale, considering that they were of Irish manufacture. 
                They are now getting into a third edition, and much of their success 
                may probably be ascribed to the fact of their never having been 
                puffed; for no man excites more notice than he who runs counter 
                to the fashion’ (p.&nbsp;[v]). It also states: ‘when this work 
                was nearly ready for publication, a calamitous fire reduced the 
                printer’s establishment to ashes. The “Traits and Stories” unhappily 
                shared the same fate: the first edition went off brilliantly in 
                the course of one night. Had the book appeared as it was then 
                printed, it would have rivalled any thing coming from the first 
                houses of London. It was again put through the press in a hurry, 
                and under circumstances highly disadvantageous; and yet its typographical 
                execution is certainly creditable to the country’ (pp.&nbsp;vii–viii).

                than one volume; but what authors have to do with the rule seemed 
                to me inexplicable, especially as they are at liberty to consult

                by the peculiar spirit of the last reign, and manifestly at variance 
                with that of the present times […] The only apology admissible 
                for a fashionable novel, is the successful exposure of vices and 
                follies daily and hourly generated by the corruptions of society’ 
                (p.&nbsp;[iii]). It also notes how ‘The sketches contained in 
                “Mothers and Daughters” are sanctioned as correct, by the very 
                class most interested in their refutation’ (p.&nbsp;iv). Titles

                of publication, and perhaps more convenient to readers in general.

                the “Encyclopædia of Romance” feels it his duty to furnish his 
                readers with the objects he has had in view in the present undertaking. 
                He has long entertained the idea of presenting the public with 
                a series of Tales and Romances, both original and translated, 
                at a price which might place them within the reach of the humblest, 
                as well as the highest classes of society. // Encouraged by the 
                flattering reception already accorded to another publication (“The 
                Ladies’ Cabinet”) emanating from the same source, he has spared 
                neither pains nor expense in overcoming the difficulties he has 
                had to encounter in the completion of his design.—The present 
                publication is the result of those efforts.—“The Encyclopædia 
                of Romance” will be continued in Monthly Numbers, containing 144 
                pages of letter-press. […] translations shall be confined exclusively 
                to such tales as have never appeared before in an English dress, 
                with abridgement of such of the larger and more expensive foreign 
                novels as we think may suit the taste of the English reader. He 
                will thus be put in possession of a collection of the best specimens 
                of works of fiction that every European language can supply, in 
                a form greatly cheaper than the cheapest, and quite as good as 
                any that have been published in a more expensive shape.’ Vol. 
                1 contains: ‘St. Sylvester’s Night’, pp.&nbsp;[3]–40; ‘The Abbey 
                of Maubuisson’, pp.&nbsp;40–54; ‘Omar and Susana; or, the Apothecary 
                of Ispahan’, pp.&nbsp;54–122; ‘The Adventures of a Gentleman of 
                Champaigne, at Paris, in the Year 1833’, pp.&nbsp;123–137; ‘The 
                Tales of the Twelve Soobahs of Indostan’, pp.&nbsp;138–253; ‘Generosa’, 
                pp.&nbsp;253–284. Vol. 2 consists of ‘The Captive. A Tale of Modern 
                Times’, pp.&nbsp;[3]–219; ‘Pelagius’, pp.&nbsp;220–264; ‘Boyucci’, 
                pp.&nbsp;265–288. Vol. 3 comprises James Kirke Paulding’s ‘Westward 
                Ho!’. <i>Westward Ho!</i> was also published separately in 1833, 
                in 2 vols. (see 1833: 55[b] for further details). This item is 
                included because of its incorporation of a substantial amount

                ‘New York, May, 1832’, notes: ‘The great aim of the author has 
                been to combine an important moral, with the interest of a series 
                of incidents, and sketches of scenery, character, manners, and 
                modes of thought and expression, such as he knows or imagines 
                exist, in particular portions of the United States. […] For very 
                many of his ideas of the great Mississippi Valley the author is 
                under particular obligations to the “Recollections” of the Rev. 
                Timothy Flint, which contain by far the most picturesque description 
                of that remarkable region which has ever fallen under his observation’

                reproach, combined with the assurance of friends and publishers, 
                that it required more aristocratic affliction to interest the 
                novel reading public, has induced her to attempt a story in the 
                style at present considered the most popular. […] Oonagh Lynch 
                is of a different and more romantic description. The preference 
                shown to either of these stories, will decide the caste of any 
                future fiction attempted by the same writer, should she again 
                appear before the public.’ ‘Aims and Ends’ runs to vol. 2 (p.&nbsp;203),

                write a book which is intendent, and calculated, solely for the 
                readers of fiction and prefix to it an apology addressed to the 
                non-readers of fiction, appears somewhat paradoxical; yet as a 
                member of a religious society, whose sentiments are openly and 
                professedly at variance with works of this description, I would 
                not willingly oppose the peculiarities of many whom I regard with 
                gratitude, esteem, and admiration, without offering in my own 
                vindication some remarks upon the nature of fiction in general. 
                […] when a writer keeps steadily in view the development of moral 
                truth, when his characters are all of our “mixed essence,” drawn 
                from the scenes of every-day life, animated with our feelings, 
                weak with our frailties, led into our difficulties, surrounded 
                by our temptations, and altogether involved in a succession of 
                the same causes and effects which influence our lives, his productions 
                may be called fiction, but they cannot be false. To me they appear 
                at least as lawful as those of the painter, and for this reason

                which apparently belongs to the novel proper, the ‘authoress’ 
                sketches her life and outlines her experiences in marrying her 
                daughters: ‘I have occupied my leisure, and I trust, shall recruit 
                my finances by pourtraying characters and feelings which I believe 
                are true to nature, although under circumstances and in situations 
                not founded on fact’ (p.&nbsp;4). The tales consist of: ‘The Single

                in various passages of her “Illustrations of Political Economy.” 
                But that delightful authoress could not, consistently with her 
                plan, show, as Zschokke, the patriotic author of Goldenthal, has 
                attempted to do, the importance of the exertion of one virtuous 
                individual in reforming a depraved neighbourhood’ (p.&nbsp;[5]).

                totally inapplicable to any district in Great Britain, while the 
                chapter on the forest-lands was retained because there are still 
                some English parishes which either have in reality, or claim from 
                custom, certain forest rights; and though the Goldenthal school-master’s

                  September 21, 1834’. In this the author touches on the significance 
                  of historical facts for the composition of historical novels: 
                  ‘But I may add a more general hope, that you will long have 
                  leisure and inclination for those literary pursuits, to which 
                  you bring an erudition so extensive […]’. This is followed by 
                  a Preface, pp.&nbsp;[v]–xvi, which expatiates on how the author 
                  was induced to write the novel by a stay near the ruins of Pompeii. 
                  Also, it gives a historical and cultural summary of Pompeii.

                  of the present times: and of a sincere desire, as far as in 
                  the author lies, to strip the counterfeit of its tinsel, remove 
                  the curtain that screens imperfection, and exhibit folly and 
                  vice to public scorn and reproach, in their own scarring deformity’ 
                  (p.&nbsp;[xi]). An ‘Introduction’ follows, on pp.&nbsp;[xiii]–xvi, 
                  and is succeeded by an address ‘to the British People’, pp.&nbsp;[xvii]–xviii,

                  it emanates from the Emerald Isle, it is hoped, will not diminish

                  H.’. In this the author distances himself from the gothic device 
                  of the mysterious manuscript: ‘Unfortunately for me, it is rather 
                  <i>passé</i> to find mouldering MSS. in ponderous oaken chests. 
                  Even a supernatural roll of parchment, solemnly presented by 
                  a mysterious figure, clad in dazzlingly white raiment, would 
                  scarcely be tolerated at present. […] As, thanks to the revolutionary 
                  effects of the Waverley Novels and Political Economy, I am thus 
                  prohibited from poaching on the domains of Leadenhall Street, 
                  and, as moreover, I am by no means blessed with the organ of 
                  Imaginativeness, I think that my best chance of getting successfully 
                  through the difficult feat of an introductory chapter will spring 
                  from my telling the truth; a piece of author-craft which will, 
                  at least, have the charm of novelty to recommend it’ (pp.&nbsp;[v]–vi). 
                  He then proceeds to present the work as having derived from 
                  autobiographical papers left by one of his former school fellows.

                  author disavows authorship of ‘A Book, entitled “Popular Stories 
                  and Legends of the Peasantry of Ireland, with Illustrations, 
                  by Samuel Lover,” […] lately […] published in Dublin’. This 
                  adds: ‘Six illustrations for the volume were supplied by me, 
                  and those who are answerable for the work should have let the 
                  public distinctly understand that <i>so far only</i> was I concerned, 
                  and not have imputed to me, by a questionable use of my name, 
                  an authorship which I feel it necessary to disavow. // From 
                  the duplicity of this title, many have been induced to imagine 
                  that the work, to which it is prefixed, is <i>my</i> Second 
                  Series of Legends and Stories; and this very name, too, has 
                  been assumed, with a mere transposition, the book being entitled 
                  “Stories and Legends”, although <i>there is not a single legend 
                  in its pages</i>’ (p.&nbsp;viii). The work in question is probably 
                  <i>Popular Tales and Legends of the Irish Peasantry. With Illustrations 
                  by S. Lover</i> (see 1834: 17). An addendum to the same Notice 
                  reads: ‘The very great popularity with which Barny O’Reirdon, 
                  the Navigator, was favoured on its appearance in the Dublin 
                  University Magazine, has induced me to add it, along with Little 
                  Fairly, from the same quarter, to the following Collection of

                  originally composed with a view to sustaining it as anonymous. 
                  This design being now however abandoned […] it may be proper 
                  to inform the reader, that he can obtain a more full account 
                  of the various transactions alluded to in the singular paper 
                  left to Charles Arran (whose real name was Charles Hamilton) 
                  by his father. This account will be found in a volume written 
                  by the latter gentleman, and entitled “Transactions during the 
                  reign of Queen Anne”&nbsp;’ (pp.&nbsp;[vii]–viii). ‘Statement 
                  and Correspondence Relative to Captain Marryat’ occupies pp.&nbsp;377–403 
                  in vol. 3. This is signed ‘William Johnson Neale, Author of 
                  Cavendish’ and is dated ‘November, 1834’. It consists of a correspondence, 
                  in which Neale accuses Marryat of having exposed his name to 
                  the public and of having severely attacked his work <i>The Port 
                  Admiral</i> (1833: 52) in the <i>Metropolitan Magazine</i>. 
                  In his report of the argument Neale notes that ‘being totally 
                  unable by the use of any terms to bring him [Captain Marryat] 
                  to the field, nothing remained for me but to place upon him 
                  such a mark of public opprobrium, as should effectually exclude 
                  him without the pale of gentlemanlike society. In resorting 
                  to corporeal conflict with an individual of twice my own personal 
                  weight and strength, and age, it could not be the gratification 
                  of angry feeling which I sought, but simply the discharge of 
                  a public duty […] This duty I performed then on the afternoon 
                  of Wednesday the fifth instant, in open day-light, in Trafalgar 
                  Square, Charing Cross. A correct statement of these circumstances 
                  appears in the Sunday Herald’ (pp.&nbsp;397–398). The following 
                  pages (pp.&nbsp;398–399) quotes extensively from the <i>Sunday 
                  Herald</i>: ‘Captain Marryat […] began to untie his cloak which 
                  Mr. Neale gave him full time to do, and, stepping into the road, 
                  placed himself in a position for the attack, which he evidently 
                  mediated […] Several blows now quickly passed between the combatants 
                  […] [when] two or three individuals rushed forward, but the 
                  only one who interfered was Mr. Neale’s brother […] who to this 
                  moment had contented himself with quietly looking on […] Mr. 
                  Neale at the same time made a violent effort, and Captain Marryat 
                  rolled over in the mud. Neale now sprang to his feet, as did 
                  also the gallant Captain, who was again advancing to the attack 
                  of his unarmed foe, who having lost his stick, caught up some 
                  of the rubbish […] and directed it at the Captain’s face […] 
                  “Both parties now called out for the police, but none arriving, 
                  Mr. Neale […] walked very deliberately away, and wished the 
                  gallant Captain ‘good morning’ ”&nbsp;’. Printer’s marks and

                    bearing titles similar to that of “Marston” have appeared; 
                    but, were there no other evidence, the difference of the story 
                    would at once prove that there has been no “conveying” in 
                    the case. Competition then need hardly be disclaimed; and 
                    it would have been madness, indeed, for a novice to enter 
                    the lists with a writer at once so elegant and profound as 
                    the author of “Darnley.”&nbsp;’ The author is presumably referring 
                    here to G. P.&nbsp;R. James’s <i>The Life and Adventures of 
                    John Marston Hall</i> (1834: 39). The present novel has been 
                    attributed to Rosalia St. Clair (see e.g. BLPC, NSTC), but 
                    wrongly so; and indeed such a prefatory statement from the 
                    prolific hand of this pseudonymous writer would be disingenuous 
                    in the extreme. MC (9 Feb 1835) gives as ‘By Madame de St. 
                    Claire, née Rumbold’, and it could be that the attribition 
                    to Rosalia St. Clair stems from this; however, the attribution 
                    to ‘Madame de St. Claire’ can only remain tentative at present, 
                    as there is no substantiating evidence for this ascription 
                    elsewhere. The ABu copy is in blue paper wrappers, apparently 
                    original. Main narrative describes English characters in a 
                    European setting, with some passages of French and Italian.

                    contained in the following sheets, were first comitted to 
                    paper—having laid them aside, on being anticipated in my design 
                    by the appearance of the “Extracts from the Diary of a Physician;” 
                    [i.e. 1832: 86] nor is it likely that I would ever again have 
                    resumed my intention of laying them before the Public, if 
                    my friends had not flattered me into a belief that my performance

                    as to the Genius of the Place, are dedicated these Fruits, 
                    gathered on the Soul of Italian Fiction’, dated ‘<i>London</i>, 
                    Dec. 1, 1835’. Prefatory notice, pp.&nbsp;[vii]–xiii, with 
                    same date, states: ‘I began this tale two years ago at Rome. 
                    On removing to Naples, I threw it aside for “The Last Days 
                    of Pompeii,” which required more than “Rienzi” the advantage 
                    of residence within reach of the scenes described. The fate 
                    of the Roman Tribune continued, however, to haunt and impress 
                    me, and, sometime after “Pompeii” was published, I renewed 
                    my earlier undertaking. I regarded the completion of these 
                    volumes, indeed, as a kind of duty;—for having had occasion 
                    to read the original authorities from which modern historians 
                    have drawn their accounts of the life of Rienzi, I was led 
                    to believe that a very remarkable man had been superficially 
                    judged, and a very important period crudely examined. And 
                    this belief was sufficiently strong to induce me at first 
                    to mediate a more serious work upon the life and times of 
                    Rienzi. Various reasons concurred against their project—and 
                    I renounced the Biography to commence the Fiction. I have 
                    still, however, adhered with a greater fidelity than is customary 
                    in Romance, to all the leading events of the public life of 
                    the Roman Tribune; and the Reader will perhaps find in these 
                    pages a more full and detailed account of the rise and fall 
                    of Rienzi, than in any English work of which I am aware. […] 
                    If I may use the word Epic in its most modest and unassuming 
                    acceptation, this Fiction, in short, though indulging in dramatic 
                    situation, belongs, as a whole, rather to the Epic than the 
                    Dramatic school’ (pp.&nbsp;[vii]–ix). Errata to vols. 2 and 
                    3 pasted on last page of each respective vol. Narrative proper 
                    ends on vol. 3, p.&nbsp;343, and is followed by ‘Notes to

                    the critical world, should her little work find its way there, 
                    she has nothing to say in extenuation of the sometimes imputed 
                    error of taking up the pen, nor in defence of the produce 
                    of her literary hours. The circumstance, however, that the 
                    present volume is her first offence, should it be so construed, 
                    as well as the nature of the compositions submitted to the 
                    public, should exempt her from great blame, if it does not 
                    from cavil. She is, however, quite aware, that when an author 
                    ventures to publish, he has no reason to consider himself 
                    harshly dealt with, when reminded, in a proper spirit, of 
                    his faults. The conference has been voluntarily sought, and, 
                    to a certain degree, the result ought to be patiently received. 
                    Although criticism is too often founded upon acrimony and 
                    party feeling; yet she cannot but hope, that in the present 
                    instance, as there is but little in the volume itself to merit 
                    and hostile attack, and nothing as regards herself to provoke 
                    one, she may escape the ordeal with the expression of that 
                    opinion which an impartial consideration of its pretentions 
                    ought honestly to draw forth’ (pp.&nbsp;vii–viii). Continuous

                    to ‘the completion of the First Volume of our little Miscellany’, 
                    and is immediately followed by ‘Index’, these forming together 
                    two unn. pages immediately prior to the individual numbers, 
                    each of which are 8 pp.&nbsp;long. First number, described 
                    at head as ‘No 1, Vol I’, is dated alongside ‘Thursday, April 
                    2, 1835’, with the price given as ‘One Penny’. Each weekly 
                    number (similarly priced) usually has a lurid illustration 
                    before the main printed text, and there is a large fictional 
                    component in the contents, with some stories continuing through 
                    several numbers. Copy seen lacks separate t.p. for vol. 2, 
                    which commences at no. 49, dated ‘Thursday, February 18, 1836’. 
                    This sequence ends with no. 91, dated ‘Thursday, December 
                    8, 1836’, and at foot of last page ‘All published’ is written 
                    in hand. The Bodleian copy described here is bound in one 
                    volume, and lacks vol. 1, nos. 15 and 24, and vol. 2, nos.

                    Series of this work (entitled the Romance of Ancient History) 
                    has been mistaken in several instances for quite another book, 
                    The Romance of History, the author has judged it best, agreeably 
                    to the suggestion of his friends, to prefix the present title 
                    to this second Series. The plan observed in this part of the 
                    work is exactly the same as that pursued in the foregoing 
                    portion of it. Herodotus is still the historian from whom 
                    he makes his selections, and his scenes are still drawn from 
                    the second book of this writer, which contains the history 
                    of Egypt’ (p.&nbsp;[v]). This is followed by an ‘Introduction’, 
                    pp.&nbsp;[vii]–xi. The items comprise: ‘The Ovethrow of Tyranny’, 
                    pp.&nbsp;[1]–131; ‘Preliminary Note’ (p.&nbsp;[132]) to ‘The 
                    Retreat of Sabako’, which itself runs from p.&nbsp;[133] to 
                    the end of vol. 2. Signatures are labelled ‘Vol. I’ and ‘Vol.

                    June 26, 1835’. In this the authoress expresses diffidence 
                    in ‘sending forth to the world a tale which by its title gives 
                    promise of treating not only of history, but of Scottish history; 
                    an act of presumption of which she is anxious to clear herself;—and 
                    at the same time she wished to reassure those readers who 
                    may not like historical novels from a woman’s pen, that she 
                    has entered no farther into public affairs, than as they may 
                    have influence the fortunes and feelings of one admirable 
                    woman who forms the subject of the following memoir’ (p.&nbsp;[iii]). 
                    The preface ends by observing that ‘[f]or reasons which may 
                    be understood by her friends […] the tale of Blanche was written 
                    in the year 1832’. The constituent tales are: ‘Winifred, Countess 
                    of Nithsdale’, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;[1]–vol. 2, p.&nbsp;157; ‘The 
                    Hampshire Cottage’, vol. 2, pp.&nbsp;[159]–336; and ‘Blanche’,

                    dated 25 Mar 1835, begins: ‘The original of the following 
                    Work was first published in Italy about three years ago. Its 
                    appearance excited considerable sensation in that country, 
                    from the circumstance of its author being a son-in-law of 
                    the justly celebrated Manzoni, which gave rise to an idea 
                    that the author of “<i>I Promessi Sposi</i>” might probably 
                    have had a hand in its composition. The Translator’s attention 
                    was first drawn to the book from seeing its publication announced 
                    in those terms by the “Foreign Quarterly Review.” It has since 
                    obtained popularity on the Continent and been translated into

                    ‘Saughtree, Liddesdale, March, 1835’, describes this work 
                    as ‘fictitious biography’, apologizing for the fact that the 
                    author is ‘not so much satisfied with the work himself’. This 
                    concludes: ‘On the whole, he [i.e. the author] certainly does 
                    entertain an opinion that it contains something of a redeeming

                      until it had finally gone to Press, he begs to state that 
                      he is perfectly aware of the inaccuracies which occur; and 
                      also to observe that the divisions into Chapters are entirely 
                      different from the author’s intentions. This will account 
                      for the apparent abruptness of many of the transitions. 
                      The Editor.’ Wolff adds: ‘My guess would be that he was 
                      so anxious to pirate a work popular in England before anybody 
                      else got a good text that he reprinted from serial publication 
                      and probably had to leave out some part that had not got 
                      to him. Only a detailed comparison with the first English

                      the business of art, to combine the most striking features 
                      of nature, whether beautiful or sublime, in the character, 
                      situations, passions, and moral relations of man, as well 
                      as in the visible creation, and to paint those perfect combinations, 
                      which, though they may sometimes exist, escape the eye of 
                      superficial observation; and the noblest purpose of art, 
                      above the selfish and sordid interests of life, to prove 
                      them incompatible with true and perfect happiness, and to 
                      teach man, even by the means of his imagination, that there 
                      is reserved for him a higher existence, from whence the 
                      lights of religion, morality, and beauty gleam faintly into 
                      this; a virtue surpassing, in the holiness and purity of 
                      its attributes, that knowledge which is expediency. […] 
                      The novel is the style of fiction most in favour at the 
                      present day, and I am prejudiced by no undue partiality 
                      for my own pursuit when I consider it as a species of epic—equally 
                      subject to the same rules and capable of the same lofty 
                      purposes, as that elaborate form of composition’ (pp.&nbsp;[iii]–iv).

                      which several of the following sketches received on their 
                      original appearance in different periodicals’ (pp.&nbsp;[iii]–iv). 
                      Lists of contents precedes narratives proper in each vol. 
                      (vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;[vii]–viii; vol. 2, 1 p.&nbsp;unn.; vol. 
                      3, pp.&nbsp;[vii]–viii). Vol. 3 was issued with an imprint 
                      date of 1837, and carried a variant t.p. which reads: ‘Sketches 
                      by Boz: Illustrative of Every-Day Life, and Every-Day People. 
                      The Second Series. Complete in One Volume.’ However, internal 
                      textual evidence points to the original conception of this 
                      ‘Second Series’ as the 3rd vol. of the work. This 3rd vol. 
                      has an additional engraved t.p. preceding the printed t.p., 
                      which reads: ‘Second Series Sketches by Boz / London / John 
                      Macrone. St. James’s Square / 1836.’ A frontispiece appears 
                      on the verso opposite the engraved t.p. and depicts ‘Vauxhall 
                      Gardens by Day’, referring to ‘Vol. III, p.&nbsp;217’, rather 
                      than treating this 2nd ser. as separate; it also bears the 
                      legend ‘London, John Macrone, 1836’. Vol. 3 also contains 
                      a separate Preface, pp.&nbsp;[i]–iii, dated ‘Furnival’s 
                      Inn. December 17, 1836.’, which comments: ‘Some of these 
                      sketches were written before the appearance of the former 
                      series, and the remainder, have been added at different 
                      periods since that time. […] With these few words, [the

                      This addresses (without noticeably answering) the issue 
                      of why Wales ‘should so long be neglected by dramatists

                      somewhat hackneyed species, the “National Novel”&nbsp;’, 
                      but rather attempts ‘to present certain portraitures of

                      as well as national history’ of Wales (p.&nbsp;vii). This

                      George Douglas, Esquire, Advocate, Sheriff of Kincardineshire, 
                      as a Sincere Tribute of his Respect and Esteem.’ This is 
                      followed by a ‘Note’, p.&nbsp;[3], dated ‘Dundee, October, 
                      1835’, and signed ‘J. M. C.’. This states: ‘The Editor of 
                      this volume has to apologize to Mr. Grant’s subscribers 
                      for the great delay which has taken place in issuing it 
                      after the time specified in the prospectuses, but he trusts 
                      that when they consider the loss of time necessarily incident 
                      on the melancholy death of the author, and on the removal 
                      of the establishment at which it was printing from Dundee 
                      to Perth, that they will exculpate him from the charge of 
                      unnecessary procrastination. […] It was proposed by the 
                      original prospectuses of the volume—issued by Mr Grant—that 
                      it should consist entirely of Prose Tales, under the title 
                      of “Tales of the Glens.” This title has been retained; but, 
                      as Mr Grant did not live to complete the volume on the original 
                      plan, the Editor has introduced a selection from Mr Grant’s 
                      poetical pieces, as he deemed that it would be more pleasing 
                      to subscribers to have a specimen of Mr Grant’s abilities, 
                      both as a Prose Writer and a Poet, than to have the volume 
                      completed with Prose Sketches, before published, which was 
                      the alternative. Should a Second Edition be called for, 
                      the Editor will have it in his power to greatly enlarge 
                      and enrich it, from selections from Mr Grant’s manuscripts, 
                      which the prescribed limits of the present volume did not 
                      allow him to insert.’ A list of contents, pp.&nbsp;[5]–6, 
                      and a ‘Memoir of Joseph Grant’, pp.&nbsp;[7]–16, follow. 
                      A newly paginated sequence combining roman and arabic pagination, 
                      begins with a Preface, pp.&nbsp;[i]–iii, which notes: ‘I 
                      beg leave to hope, that, however little amusement or instruction 
                      the following Tales may contain, they are at least unmingled 
                      with aught that is likely to hurt the moral feelings, or 
                      outrage the taste of the most refined reader’ (p.&nbsp;iii). 
                      The tales consist of: ‘The Grocer’s Daughter’, pp.&nbsp;[5]–42;

                      of the succeeding Tales is sufficiently hackneyed, and has 
                      already been several times beautifully treated. More especially 
                      by Mr. Griffin in his admirable tale of “The Collegians;” 
                      by Lord Mulgrave, and by the elegant author of the “Tales 
                      of a Chaperon.” // It has been though however that something 
                      was yet left to be done upon this subject; and that writers 
                      in general have fallen into the error of attributing the 
                      uneasiness which they describe, rather to a certain ignorance 
                      of external forms, and unhappiness in merely conventional 
                      details, which any girl of sense and spirit would overcome 
                      in a few months, than to that radical opposition in habits, 
                      sentiments, tastes, and feelings, which renders domestic 
                      happiness so rarely attainable, in cases of this kind.’

                      of vol. 2; this being followed by ‘A Tale of an Oak Tree’ 
                      (poetry), pp.&nbsp;[37]–72; and ‘Love and Duty’, which fills 
                      pp.&nbsp;[73]–272 and all of vol. 3. Vols. 1 and 3 have

                      pale,—to tyranny in every cabinet,—to monopoly in every

                      every section of the Church ‘kindred to that of a lover’. 
                      The author compares the adventures of Don Poplin to those 
                      of Quixote, as a ‘farrago of heterogeneous topics’, and 
                      directly addresses ‘Tory reviewers’, from whom he knows

                      begins: ‘When I first determined upon writing a tale of 
                      fiction as a resource against “Leisure hours”—those mental 
                      vampires which suck all the health of fitful occupation—I 
                      was particularly desirous of fixing upon an entirely new 
                      subject.’ (p.&nbsp;[v]) The author speculates writing a 
                      romance, a satire of high life, or sketches of ‘the lower 
                      Irish’, before settling somewhere in the middle: ‘Thus, 
                      between ghosts and gourmands, the spirit and the flesh, 
                      I was nearly scared altogether from my undertaking, when 
                      an opportune visit to Paris, by introducing “animal magnetism” 
                      to my notice, suggested to me that the point I sought “might 
                      lie between”—it professing to be that mysterious point between 
                      mind and matter, too material in its effects to be all mind, 
                      and too subtile to be all matter!’ (pp.&nbsp;vii–viii).

  Summers (pp.&nbsp;14–15) comments: ‘The “Bos” parodies and imitations of Dickens 
  were written in collaboration by Thomas Peckett Prest, William Bayle Bernard, 
  and Morris Barnett. Lloyd the publisher suggested the idea of travesties of 
  the popular Dickens […] After some discussion “Bos” was fixed upon, and in spite 
  of protests from Charles Dickens and his publishers Lloyd issued “Bos” tales 
  very successfully for five or more years’. Preface (1 p.&nbsp;unn.), subscribed 
  ‘&nbsp;“Bos.” / Brompton Square’, notes: ‘In fulfilment of the promise, made 
  at the commencement of this work; we conclude it with the present—or twelfth 
  number. It is true the extraordinary sale our “Sketch Book” has had, might have 
  tempted us to exceed the limits originally proposed; but when we reflected upon 
  the pledge given, we at once abandoned all selfish considerations of profit, 
  and the work is now finished. […] In no one instance have our pages been sullied, 
  with a sentence that might raise a blush or shock morality. We have studied 
  to improve the minds of our readers, and though many of our subjects are of 
  a comic vein, their design is to point out, and discourage the follies that 
  occasionally creep into society. […] we will now take a respectful leave of 
  our numerous readers, assuring them that ere long we shall meet again; a Second 
  Series of the “Sketch Book” being already in a state of forwardness.’ Index

                      published by him [the author] in various periodical works; 
                      to these old papers, however, he has in many instances added 
                      new matter […]. To these some essays are appended, not till 
                      now printed. The Author is compelled, in self-defence, to 
                      claim the papers <i>reprinted</i> in this volume, because 
                      he has found that […] they are dropping piecemeal out of 
                      his hands into the hands of persons who have not so much 
                      right to them. For instance: one worthy takes the greater 
                      part of a sketch […] and introducing it with some few prefatory 
                      paragraphs of his own, passes off the whole as original,—bestowing 
                      not a thought or a lime [<i>sic</i>] of note or explanation 
                      on the poor “original original”&nbsp;’ (pp.&nbsp;[iii]–iv). 
                      The preface also notes: ‘Should this first book of “Glances 
                      at Life” prove welcome […] the Author will look around him 
                      again to see what is to be seen, and […] will only be too 
                      happy to make his second bow should the call become loud

          how little I have dealt with the horrors of the time.—The purpose of 
          my title is to direct the work into the hands of those whom it most 
          concerns; and my personages are few because it is my object to show, 
          in a confined space, how long a series of evils may befall individuals 
          in a society conducted like that of Ireland […] As for the incidents 
          of the tale, my choice was influenced by the consideration, not of what 
          would best suit the purposes of fiction, but of what would most serve 
          the cause of the Irish poor. A much more thrilling and moving story 
          might have been made of conspiracy, rebellion, and slaughter by weapon 
          and by gibbet; but theses scenes want no further development than may 
          be found in our daily newspapers’ (p.&nbsp;ii). ‘Summary of Principles

  2 (<b>Additional Titles Not Included in Main Section</b>)</font></font></strong></p>
         
          <p align="justify">Appendix 2 is not intended as an overflow for works 
            of fiction that should have been included in the main listings, nor 
            is it necessarily an entirely comprehensive survey of works from each 
            category. Sections A–E detail types of fiction in the period which 
            are considered not to represent novels in the sense required for entry 
            in the main listings, while nevertheless containing a significant 
            amount of fictional matter. Section A provides entries for works which 
            would have been directed principally towards a juvenile (i.e. post-pubescent) 
            audience. Section B supplies details of miscellanies, occasional works, 
            and multi-genre collections, which have a significant prose fiction 
            content, but are nonetheless too varied to be considered ‘mainstream’ 
            fiction. Works included in Section C have a heavily didactic and/or 
            religious component, which subsumes or overrides the fictional elements 
            of the narrative. Section D describes fictional titles aiming to illustrate 
            local histories and manners, areas of topographical interest, or travel 
            writings, within which the fictional component appears to play a subordinate 
            part in the matter being described. Section E contains a sampling 
            of biographical accounts and memoirs that have seemingly fictionalized 
            elements. Section F includes one title which, apparently not having 
            survived, leaves an element of doubt about its existence or suitability 
            for entry.</p>

          I add, that having written, and having published; I humbly and earnestly 
          trust that some advantage, far beyond either fame or riches, may arise, 
          both to the writer and the reader. It will be so, if I should be the 
          means of directing any one eye to that light which is from above; or

          <i>Notes.</i> Although apparently conceived of as a periodical, the 
          work in its present form effectively constitutes an autonomous two-vol. 
          collection. Vol. 2 has a nearly identical t.p. to vol. 1, with the only 
          modification being: ‘Embellished by Eighty Engravings, Designed and 
          Executed by W. H. Brooke.’ Frontispiece to vol. 1 illustrates ‘The Humourist 
          and her Crew’, a ship on wheels drawn by a mule and escorted by three 
          one-legged men; while that of vol. 2 depicts ‘Emigration’. Preface, 
          vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;[v]–ix, states: ‘On presenting an addition to the already 
          extensive list of Annuals, the Author feels called upon to say a few 
          words by way of preface, in doing which he cannot but acknowledge that 
          the Publisher and himself are very much in the situation of the sailors 
          in the Frontispiece: they have just launched a new vessel, and are soliciting 
          the favour and patronage of the Public, in the absence of which they 
          will inevitably be found in one of the most awkward of all nautical 
          dilemmas, namely, without a <i>sale</i>. // Should his Readers carry 
          the simile still farther, and allege, with reference to the one-legged 
          mariners, that it is a lame affair, the Author would plead a classical 
          authority for pleading his lucubrations “<i>stans pede in uno</i>” […] 
          The Author is quite aware that it will avail him little to plead, in 
          extenuation of the imperfections of the work, the fact of his having 
          been called to it at an advanced period of the last spring; yet, as 
          he will not again labour under a similar disadvantage—and he has found 
          it no trifling one—he may reasonably indulge the hope of rendering The 
          Humourist, for next year, more worthy of the patronage of the Public. 
          In the mean time, he begs, respectfully, to present to them the fruit 
          of his present labours.’ Preface to vol. 2, pp.&nbsp;[v]–viii, begins: 
          ‘Were the Author, after having so frequently presented himself in the 
          arena of letters, to repeat his apology for the intrusion in this instance, 
          he would, probably, obtain as little credit for sincerity as certain 
          other performers, whose affection for the public leads them to convert 
          a tragedy into a farce, by taking a “last farewell” of heir “patrons” 
          every year’ (p.&nbsp;[iii]). Each vol. has list of contents, (vol. 1, 
          pp.&nbsp;[xi]–xii; vol. 2, p.&nbsp;[x]) and table of illustrations (vol. 
          1, pp.&nbsp;[xiii]–xiv; vol. 2, pp.&nbsp;[x]–xii). Vol. 1 contains:

          of “Conversations with an Ambitious Student,” attracted much favourable 
          attention; and I have been often earnestly requested to collect and 
          republish them. I postponed, however, doing so, from time to time’ (p.&nbsp;[vii]). 
          It later states: ‘I should observe that they belong rather to the poetical 
          than the logical philosophy—that […] they address the sentiment rather 
          than the intellect—choosing for their materials the metaphysics of the 
          heart and the passions, which are more often employed in the Fiction 
          than the Essay’ (pp.&nbsp;viii–ix). List of contents (1 p.&nbsp;unn.)

          at intervals, since 1825, as contributions to a Periodical Work. The 
          favourable reception with which most of them were honoured on their 
          several and separate appearance has induced their re-publication in 
          their present form. […] Of the narratives, if they have the good fortune 
          to amuse, few readers will enquire whether they be founded, or not, 
          on fact. But some of them are so: after all, fact is the best foundation 
          for a superstructure of fiction.’ Each vol. has its own contents pages

          of John Nicol, Mariner,” and “The Life of Alexander Selkirk,” had been 
          received, while it has encouraged me to attempt the present work, renders 
          it necessary for me to explain how it happened, that a humble individual 
          like myself should have ventured to appear before the Public as a biographer’ 
          (p.&nbsp;[i]). It then describes how the editor got possession of Alexander’s 
          manuscripts: ‘To the hero of the present work I was introduced by the 
          publisher, whose active humanity was interested in his behalf. By appointment 
          I met Alexander in Mr. B.’s shop, and had some conversation with him 
          concerning the manuscripts he had brought in town. […] As we conversed, 
          I found he had undergone a strange variety of fortune. At the request 
          of Mr. B., I took one portion of his manuscript home with me to peruse. 
          I found it confusedly written, and many interesting facts mixed up with 
          extraneous matter’ (pp.&nbsp;iv–v). The ‘editor’ also mentions that 
          he has ‘read and made extracts from above four thousand folio pages 
          of manuscript’ and that his ‘labours have been greatly facilitated by 
          he presence and conversation of Alexander, as every page of the work 
          was read to him, for his correction and approval’ (p.&nbsp;vi). ‘Alexander 
          Alexander’ was Alexander Humphrys (1783–1859), son of a Birmingham merchant, 
          who went abroad with his son in 1802, was imprisoned in France till 
          1814, changed his name in 1824, took the title of ‘Earl of Stirling 
          and Davon’ in 1824, and was later tried in 1839 for forging his title.

          ‘The Malayan biographical tract of which the following is a translation,

          its conclusion, but that it must have been finished ‘about the year 
          1788’ (p.&nbsp;[i]), and that the ‘manuscript was sent to England in

          <i>Notes.</i> Preface, pp.&nbsp;[v]–vii, notes: ‘That “Truth is sometimes 
          more wonderful than Fiction,” is a truism long since recognised by the 
          philosopher and traveller; and, however incredible some portion of the 
          following pages may appear, I can solemnly aver, be their merits or 
          demerits otherwise what they may, that they have at least been written 
          with a scrupulous regard to truth’ (p.&nbsp;[v]). It also states: ‘A 
          portion of the narrative was written some time ago, solely for the amusement 
          […] my humble name and fortunes would probably never have claimed the 
          public attention, but for the accidental meetings of an old friend and 
          messmate, who, during the history of my adventures sufficiently interesting 
          (if not to edify) at least to amuse, kindly undertook to assist me in 
          the compilation from my journals, my various rough notes and MS. papers 
          for the press’ (pp.&nbsp;vi–vii). Autobiographical account, with some 
          fictional elements, by Bowers (1784–1845); BP notes: ‘Lieut. Towne, 
          R.N., was the Editor’. Lists of contents occupy pp.&nbsp;[ix]–xxv in

          <i>Notes.</i> Trans. of <i>La Vendée et Madame</i> (Paris, 1833). This 
          translated version evidently originates from the 1st edn., in which 
          Dumas was involved, rather than a 2nd edn. of 1834, from which Dermoncourt 
          removed much of Dumas’ original input, owing to political differences 
          between the two. Frontispiece portrait depicts the ‘Duchess of Berry’. 
          Imprint line underneath gives date of publication: ‘London. Published 
          Octr. 1833, by Bull &amp; Churton, 26, Holles Street’. Preface, pp.&nbsp;[iii]–viii, 
          dated ‘Paris, September 10th, 1833’, notes: ‘If I have determined to 
          publish this book, it is neither because I am labouring under an illusion 
          respecting the military importance of the late war in La Vendée, nor 
          because I fancy that I have so particularly distinguished myself in 
          this war’ (p.&nbsp;[iii]), adding later that ‘Few persons, I may be 
          allowed to say, are better able than I, to publish such a book as the 
          present, to give the general plan of attack and defence in this war, 
          to pursue it through all its details, both political and military, and, 
          lastly, to enter into those particulars, which impart to a narrative 
          its picturesque character’ (p.&nbsp;vii). In addition, the ‘editor’ 
          informs the reader: ‘Part of my narrative is founded upon official documents 
          still in my possession […] Many of the circumstances were related to 
          me by the Duchess of Berri herself’ (p.&nbsp;viii). Engraved portrait 
          of ‘General Dermoncourt’ precedes main text, with imprint line underneath 
          giving exact date of publication: ‘Published by Bull &amp; Churton,

          <i>Notes.</i> John Jacob Astor (1763–1848) was born in Waldorf, Germany 
          and emigrated to North America in 1784. He formed the American Fur Company 
          and established a fur trading post at Fort Astor, Oregon, which eventually 
          became the settlement of Astoria. Introduction, vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;[iii]–viii, 
          signed ‘Washington Irving’ and dated ‘Sept. 1836’, notes how ‘In the 
          course of occasional visits to Canada many years since, I became intimately 
          acquainted with some of the principal partners of the great North-West 
          Fur Company’ (p.&nbsp;[iii]). It later continues: ‘I was at an age when 
          the imagination lends its colouring to every thing, and the stories 
          of these Sinbads of the wilderness made the life of a trapper and fur 
          trader perfect romance to me […] About two years ago […] I had a conversation 
          with my friend Mr. John Jacob Astor, relative to that portion of our 
          country, and to the adventurous traders to Santa Fé and the Columbia’ 
          (pp.&nbsp;iv–v). In the rest of the Introduction Irving mentions how 
          he compiled Mr Astor’s memoirs, letters and journals and subjected his 
          work to his correction, adding that ‘the work, without any laboured 
          attempt at artificial construction, actually possesses much of that 
          unity always sought after in works of fiction, and considered so important 
          to the interest in every history’ (p.&nbsp;viii). Lists of contents 
          occupy pp.&nbsp;[xi]–xvi in vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;[iii]–ix in vol. 2, and 
          pp.&nbsp;[iii]–vii in vol. 3. Incorrect pagination: pp.&nbsp;ix–x not 
          extant in vol. 1. Running title varies according to narrative contents.

          <i>Notes.</i> This title, possibly issued in competing edns., has been 
          variously associated with the following: Theodore Dwight, John Jay Slocum, 
          William K. Hoyte, William Monk [pseud?], William Leete Stone. According 
          to John Sutherland, however, ‘Maria Monk’ was the alias of an impostor, 
          who arrived in New York from Montreal, heavily pregnant, and was assisted 
          in the preparation of this work by Revd George Bourne (1780–1845), a 
          Presbyterian minister from England with fierce anti-Catholic views (see 
          <i>The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction</i> (Harlow, 1988), p.&nbsp;410). 
          Preface, pp.&nbsp;[iii]–viii, signed ‘Maria Monk. New York, 11th January, 
          1836’. This begins by asserting the account’s factuality: ‘It is hoped 
          that the reader of the ensuing narrative will not suppose that that 
          it is a fiction, or that the scenes and persons that I have delineated 
          had not a real existence’ (p.&nbsp;[iii]). First-person account, luridly 
          anti-Catholic in bias. Printer’s mark and colophon of J. and C. Adlard, 
          Bartholomew Close. Originally published New York 1836 (NSTC).<br>

      with cross-references from the shortened form where required. The index 
      lists concerns as found on the imprint (e.g. Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown,
