Lloyd the publisher suggested the idea of travesties of the popular Dickens [ ] After some discussion Bos was fixed upon, and in spite of protests from Charles Dickens and his publishers Lloyd issued Bos tales very successfully for five or more years’. Preface (1 p. unn.), subscribed ‘ Bos. / Brompton Square’, notes: ‘In fulfilment of the promise, made at the commencement of this work; we conclude it with the present—or twelfth number. It is true the extraordinary sale our Sketch Book has had, might have tempted us to exceed the limits originally proposed; but when we reflected upon the pledge given, we at once abandoned all selfish considerations of profit, and the work is now finished. [ ] In no one instance have our pages been sullied, with a sentence that might raise a blush or shock morality. We have studied to improve the minds of our readers, and though many of our subjects are of a comic vein, their design is to point out, and discourage the follies that occasionally creep into society. [ ] we will now take a respectful leave of our numerous readers, assuring them that ere long we shall meet again; a Second Series of the Sketch Book being already in a state of forwardness.’ Index (1 p. unn.) follows, listing sketches in alphabetical order.
