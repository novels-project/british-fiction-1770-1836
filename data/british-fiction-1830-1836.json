Lloyd the publisher suggested the idea of travesties of the popular Dickens [ ] After some discussion “Bos” was fixed upon, and in spite of protests from Charles Dickens and his publishers Lloyd issued “Bos” tales very successfully for five or more years’.

[ ] In no one instance have our pages been sullied, with a sentence that might raise a blush or shock morality. We have studied to improve the minds of our readers, and though many of our subjects are of a comic vein, their design is to point out, and discourage the follies that occasionally creep into society.
